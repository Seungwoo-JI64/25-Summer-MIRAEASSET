KKR outbids Advent in $6.5 billion battle to buy UK's Spectris,2025-07-02 15:20:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kkr-agrees-buy-spectris-6-062040409.html,"(Reuters) -British scientific instruments maker Spectris has agreed to a takeover offer from U.S. investment firm KKR valuing it at 4.7 billion pounds ($6.46 billion) including debt, and has withdrawn its support for a rival offer from Advent. The battle for Spectris, Britain's largest takeover target this year, heated up after KKR last week tabled a bid valuing Spectris at 40 pounds per share including dividends, 6.3% higher than Advent's 37.63 pound per share offer, which valued the group at 4.4 billion pounds. Spectris said its board has decided to withdraw its recommendation of Advent's offer in favour of the higher bid from KKR, which had made two prior takeover proposals for the London-listed firm. The firm had rejected KKR's second takeover bid on June 13. Advent, which had reserved the right to increase its offer for Spectris if a competing bid was made, did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for a comment. ""The ball is now back in Advent's court, and having stalked Spectris for an extended period, there must be some chance that it keeps fighting,"" analysts at Stifel said. ""But having already raised its bid several times, room for manoeuvre looks fairly limited to us."" Spectris shares climbed as much as 5.3% to 40.32 pounds on Wednesday to their highest in more than three and a half years. As of Tuesday's close the stock had surged nearly 88% since Advent's initial bid was disclosed on June 9. In its latest offer for Spectris, shareholders will receive 39.72 pounds per share in cash from KKR and an interim dividend of 28 pence. Britain's cheap valuations and relative stability have lured overseas buyers. KKR was also involved in a bidding war for British healthcare real estate investor Assura, which agreed a deal with KKR-Stonepeak before ditching them in favour of a higher bid from Primary Health Properties last month.

Wall Street has faith in Trump. It could all end in tears,2025-07-02 14:30:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-faith-trump-could-053000841.html,"New York Stock Exchange traders have been navigating an uncertain environment since Donald Trump launched his tariffs blitz - Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty All is forgiven. Wall Street has soared to record highs just months after Donald Trump unleashed tariff chaos on the world. The S&P 500 stock index has surged nearly 25pc from the nadir it reached in the days after the US president announced his “ liberation day ” tariffs on April 2. The benchmark completed its best quarter since December 2023 on Monday as it reached a new high, even as Trump threatens to impose fresh tariffs within weeks. This will please a president who has long viewed the stock market as an unofficial straw poll on his performance. But is such a full-throated endorsement of Trump’s economic plans justified? Not everyone is convinced. “[Stocks] are at an all time high and the risks are still there,” points out Luca Paolini, the chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management. “It is not as bad as it was but it is not as good as it was a year ago. “Our view is that it’s going to get weaker and that’s why we don’t buy into the strength of the market.” Stocks have surged even as official data, published last week, confirmed that the US economy shrank by half a percentage point at the start of the year. “The US economy is somewhat slowing and when you have those types of stock valuations, there’s not much room for deception,” says Kevin Thozet, a member of the investment committee at European asset manager Carmignac. Stock prices on the S&P 500 are trading at about 22 times earnings, which assumes that companies will experience astonishing growth in profits in coming years. “This recovery is driven entirely by soaring valuations rather than earnings upgrades, signalling underlying fragility,” Susana Cruz and Joachim Klement, analysts at stockbroker Panmure Liberum, have warned. The current stock market rally is “built on shaky ground, given the deep economic uncertainty”. There are some good reasons for stocks to have roared back since Trump announced his “liberation day” tariffs. “Markets are always navigating a very uncertain environment. The question is, ‘Is it worse or better than a few months ago?’ And I think the market, correctly so, came to the conclusion that it’s probably better,” says Paolini. “The trade war that was supposed to be terrible for the global economy. It doesn’t look like it is going to be that bad because there are going to be deals between the US-UK, US-India, Vietnam, probably Europe and Japan. “So yes, there will be higher tariffs, but we are probably going to avoid a devastating trade war of everyone against everyone else.” Rory McPherson, the chief investment officer at Wren Sterling, says: “Corporate earnings have been really strong. The earnings for the rest of the year have not been downgraded by anything like what they were downgraded in previous crises. “Yes, they have been downgraded and the downgrade for the year is almost 4pc but that’s not too far out of whack.” However, Paolini warns that the surge in stocks means there is “very limited upside from here because equities are very, very expensive”. The big question hanging over the stock market is the future of so-called US exceptionalism – the previously self-reinforcing theory that America is unique and distinct from other nations. This belief has long helped to prop up stock markets, with investors betting that American businesses will pull through even the most difficult patches. But there are signs that this faith is being shaken. The dollar has suffered its worst first half of the year since 1973 and concerns about Trump’s plans to borrow hundreds of billions have seen borrowing costs jump, prompting jokes that the president could become “Donald Truss”. “If I’m looking further out I think Trump’s policies would lead to a lower US dollar and higher interest rates,” says Thozet of Carmignac. “The Trump administration wants to have more manufacturing, more stuff made in the US and this comes with a lower dollar policy. And there’s a risk that these higher interest rates deflates the elevated prices on US equities.” The man who could make or break the Wall Street rally is Jerome Powell , the chairman of the Federal Reserve. Lower interest rates would spur economic activity and help boost corporate profits. Traders are currently pricing in two cuts before the end of 2025 and a 53pc chance of a third, anticipating that policymakers will react to a slowdown in the American jobs market, which added 139,000 jobs in May, down from 147,000 in April. However, Powell warned on Tuesday at the ECB Forum in Sintra that policymakers had kept rates “on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs”. He also warned that the “US federal fiscal path is not a sustainable one” as the Senate edged closer to approving Mr Trump’s “ One Big Beautiful Bill ”, which would cut taxes and add an estimated $3.3 trillion (£2.4 trillion) to the American government deficit over the next 10 years. Those comments will infuriate Mr Trump, who has repeatedly pressured “Too Late” Powell to cut rates. As the melodrama plays out, Wall Street waits. “It is not blind hope,” insists McPherson. “The US has a lot more upside from here.” Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Paramount Settles Trump’s ‘60 Minutes’ Suit for $16 Million,2025-07-02 14:10:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paramount-settles-trump-60-minutes-051038663.html,"(Bloomberg) — Paramount Global ( PARA ) reached a settlement with President Donald Trump over a lawsuit that alleged election interference by the company’s CBS news network when it showed two different versions of a 60 Minutes interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris in October. Most Read from Bloomberg Struggling Downtowns Are Looking to Lure New Crowds Sprawl Is Still Not the Answer California Exempts Building Projects From Environmental Law What Gothenburg Got Out of Congestion Pricing Paramount agreed to pay $16 million, including plaintiff’s fees, according to a statement from the company. What’s left will go to a future presidential library. Trump had sought damages of $20 billion. No money will be paid to him directly. The settlement doesn’t include an apology. The network has agreed to release transcripts of presidential candidate interviews in the future. Although officially unrelated, the settlement is widely viewed as critical for Paramount to gain approval from federal regulators for its pending merger with Skydance Media. CBS aired a preview of Harris’s 60 Minutes interview during its Face the Nation news program. The clip featured Harris answering a question about the relationship between the US and Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. A later 60 Minutes episode aired an edited version of Harris’s response. Trump, who had backed out of his own 60 Minutes interview, alleged in a court filing that the Harris response was “doctored to confuse, deceive, and mislead the American People in order to try and interfere in the election” and that the edit made her appear less incoherent. CBS said in a statement in response to the suit that Face the Nation had used a longer cut of Harris’s answer than 60 Minutes. “When we edit any interview, whether a politician, an athlete, or movie star, we strive to be clear, accurate and on point,” CBS said in response. “The portion of her answer on 60 Minutes was more succinct, which allows time for other subjects in a wide ranging 21-minute-long segment.” CBS had been fighting the litigation on multiple fronts, contending that Trump improperly filed it in a federal court in Texas and that the complaint was without merit. The network’s lawyers argued that the Texas consumer protection law that Trump sued under was designed to protect “consumers engaged in commercial transactions against false, misleading, and deceptive business practices, not to police editorial decisions made by news organizations with which one disagrees.” US Representative Ronny Jackson, a Republican from Texas, was added to the suit in February as a co-plaintiff. Bill Owens, the executive producer of 60 Minutes, announced in April that he was leaving the show, citing a lack of editorial independence. Scott Pelley, one of the show’s correspondents, addressed Owens’ departure on the air saying “Paramount began to supervise our content in new ways.” Bloomberg reported that prior to Owens’ decision to step down, Paramount Global Chair Shari Redstone had reviewed a list of 60 Minutes’ planned stories about Trump and indicated which ones she thought were fair and which ones she thought were problematic, though the show didn’t make changes based on her feedback. Redstone and Paramount are trying to finalize a merger with independent film and TV studio Skydance in a deal that has faced regulatory scrutiny. Trump reached a settlement with Walt Disney Co.’s ABC in December where the TV network agreed to give $15 million to Trump’s future presidential foundation or museum. Trump alleged that ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos defamed him when he said during a March 10 interview that Trump had been found “liable for rape.” A jury found Trump civilly liable in May for sexually abusing writer E. Jean Carroll in the mid-90s and that Trump had defamed her by accusing her of lying to sell a book. Meta Platforms Inc. agreed to pay $25 million to settle a 2021 Trump suit over the suspension of his social media accounts, according to the Washington Post. Meta had said at the time that Trump violated its rules against inciting violence. In light of the settlements, critics have argued that news networks and tech companies are kowtowing to Trump in order to preserve access to the White House and protect against retribution. Brendan Carr, who Trump appointed as chair of the Federal Communications Commission, has said he’d probe CBS’s editing of the interview in the context of the Skydance-Paramount merger. Carr has also revived FCC investigations into whether CBS, ABC, and Comcast Corp.’s NBC are politically biased and begun a probe into whether commercials aired on public broadcasters NPR and PBS violate federal law. Trump still has lawsuits against the Des Moines Register, book publisher Simon & Schuster and the board that awards the Pulitzer Prizes.

Merger of French and Swiss business software firms heralds new unicorn,2025-07-02 14:02:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/merger-french-swiss-business-software-050206712.html,"ZURICH (Reuters) -A merger between French business software provider LumApps and its Swiss peer Beekeeper will create a new unicorn worth about $1.1 billion, the two companies said. The deal announced on Wednesday, which is due to complete this month, is backed by British private equity group Bridgepoint, which was previously a major shareholder in LumApps and will hold a majority stake in the new firm. ""Midterm, an IPO or a trade sale are options. With the U.S. and Europe being our core markets, both would be great (IPO venue) candidates,"" said Beekeeper CEO Cristian Grossmann. The new firm's headquarters will be in Lyon, the home of LumApps, whose CEO Sebastien Ricard will lead the business. It will have approximately 600 employees worldwide. Unicorns are unlisted start-ups valued at at least $1 billion. Such firms are comparatively rare in Europe. LumApps makes software that companies use to run their intranets. ""We are trying to augment or even replace products like Microsoft's SharePoint,"" said Elie Melois, chief technology officer of LumApps, which is used by the likes of Airbus and luxury goods group LVMH. While LumApps products are mainly used by office workers, Beekeeper has an app that allows frontline staff to communicate with the rest of the company. Beekeeper, founded by graduates of ETH Zurich, counts Swiss retailer Coop and Heathrow airport among its clients. Within six months, the merged company aims to introduce a unified platform. Current revenue of around $150 million is expected to double to around $300 million by 2030. LumApps already turns a profit, and Beekeeper aims to break even this year. ""The combined group will be profitable from day one,"" Melois said. (Reporting by Oliver Hirt, Writing by Dave Graham, Editing by Miranda Murray)"
Workers ‘face retirement at 74 unless pension triple lock scrapped’,2025-07-02 14:00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/workers-face-retirement-74-unless-050000590.html,"Britons face working until they are 74 unless the Government scraps the triple lock on pensions , according to a leading think tank. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) issued the warning amid concerns that an ageing population will mean the country cannot meet its ballooning state pension bill. It said that a “substantial” increase in the age people can start claiming their state pension is required to maintain the triple lock, which guarantees payments rise by at least 2.5pc a year. Invest in Gold American Hartford Gold: #1 Precious Metals Dealer in the Nation Learn More Priority Gold: Up to $15k in Free Silver + Zero Account Fees on Qualifying Purchase Learn More Thor Metals Group: Best Overall Gold IRA Learn More Powered by Money.com - Yahoo may earn commission from the links above. Without changes to the retirement age, which is currently set at 66 for both men and women, the IFS warned that the triple lock will cost taxpayers up to £40bn a year and disproportionately hit poorer households by forcing them to work for longer. Labour and the Tories have both committed to keeping the triple lock, which ensures the state pension always rises in line with the highest wage growth, inflation or 2.5pc. The Government remains committed to a triple lock pension policy - Dan Kitwood/Getty However, the IFS said a double lock that instead linked increases in payments to wages or inflation was more sustainable for the country’s strained public finances . Official projections by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) show that spending on the state pension is set to rise from 5pc of GDP today, or £150bn, to 8pc by 2070, equivalent to £240bn. In its latest report, the IFS said: “Increases in the state pension age required to keep spending on the state pension below a certain level of national income would have to be substantial. “[Official] modelling shows that to keep public spending on the state pension below 6pc of national income while retaining the triple lock, the state pension age would have to rise to 69 by 2049 and 74 by 2069.” Its report also referenced a previous government review of the state pension age by Baroness Neville-Rolfe, which said it would have to rise significantly to prevent costs from rising sharply. Britain’s current retirement age is 66, although it will rise to 67 by 2028 before increasing again to 68 by 2046. Under the current triple lock policy of at least a 2.5pc increase, the IFS estimated that state pension payments will rise from £230 a week to £250 by 2043 in today’s money. This would raise the level of the state pension to 33pc of average earnings from just over 30pc today, but add £15bn to annual public spending by 2050 compared with lifting it in line with wage growth. The OBR has predicted that the national debt will rise from around 100pc of GDP today to 270pc in 50 years’ time without significant changes in either spending plans or in the economy’s growth rate. The surge in debt will be driven by higher pension and healthcare costs. David Miles, a top official at the watchdog, said the forecasts show “that is an unsustainable path and something has to give somewhere.” “There are significant risks,” he told the House of Lords’ Economic Affairs Committee, noting the danger of investors refusing to finance the ballooning debt. “One way to interpret that [270pc projection] is that you won’t follow that path because the bond markets will force you off it somewhere down the road, and there will be a sort of reckoning and there may have to be a significant restructuring of the role of the state, the size of the state, to reflect the demographics, the diminished productive potential of the economies.” ‘Lower living standards’ The IFS also said employers should be forced to pump more money into the private pensions of their employees. It called on bosses to put at least 3pc of revenues towards a private retirement fund, with both employees and employers gradually contributing more as their earnings rise. The institute said this would improve financial security in retirement and boost nationwide pension savings by £11bn. Paul Johnson, the director of the IFS, said: “There is a risk that policymakers have become complacent when it comes to pensions. Without decisive action, too many of today’s working-age population face lower living standards and greater financial insecurity through their retirement.” Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Asian shares are mixed as Trump's tariffs deadline looms,2025-07-02 13:43:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asian-shares-mixed-tracking-wall-044310878.html,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Asian shares were trading mixed on Wednesday as the July 9 deadline for the U.S. to strike deals with trading partners or impose higher tariffs looms. U.S. futures edged higher and oil prices were little changed. Shares fell in Japan, hit by jitters over a lack of progress in trade talks with the U.S., but they recovered much of their lost ground, trading 0.5% lower at 39,790.85. Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, pointed to President Donald Trump ’s declaration that there will be no extension of his tariff pause, which is just a week away from ending. “The message was blunt: if Tokyo won’t yield, it will pay. Tariffs of 30%, 35% or ‘whatever number we determine’ are now openly back on the table,” he said. “The negotiating table just became a pressure cooker.” Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 0.8% to 24,271.15 and the Shanghai Composite index edged 0.1% lower to 3,453.89. South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.6% to 3,072.63 after the government reported that inflation rose in June. Australia’s S&P ASX 200 climbed 0.8% to 8,605.40. Taiwan's Taiex edged up 0.1% while the Sensex in India lost 0.2%. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 dipped 0.1% to 6,198.01 for its first loss in four days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.9% to 44,494.94, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.8% to 20,202.89. Tesla tugged on the market as the relationship between its CEO, Elon Musk, and President Donald Trump soured even further . Once allies, the two have clashed recently, and Trump suggested there’s potentially “BIG MONEY TO BE SAVED” by scrutinizing subsidies, contracts or other government spending going to Musk’s companies. Tesla fell 5.3%. It has lost just over a quarter of its value so far this year, 25.5%, in large part because of Musk’s and Trump’s feud. Drops for several darlings of the artificial-intelligence frenzy also weighed on the market. Nvidia’s decline of 3% was the heaviest weight on the S&P 500. But more stocks within the index rose than fell, led by several casino companies. They rallied following a report showing better-than-expected growth in overall gaming revenue in Macao, China’s casino hub. Las Vegas Sands gained 8.9%, Wynn Resorts climbed 8.8% and MGM Resorts International rose 7.3%. Automakers outside of Tesla were also strong, with General Motors up 5.7% and Ford Motor up 4.6%. The U.S. stock market has made a stunning recovery from its springtime sell-off of roughly 20% . But challenges still lie ahead for Wall Street, with one of the largest being the continued threat of Trump’s tariffs . Many of Trump’s stiff proposed taxes on imports are currently on pause, and they’re scheduled to kick into effect in about a week. Depending on how big they are, they could hurt the economy and worsen inflation. Washington is also making progress on proposed cuts to tax rates and other measures that could send the U.S. government’s debt spiraling higher, which could raise inflation. That in turn could mean higher interest rates, which would hurt prices for bonds, stocks and other investments. Despite such challenges, strategists at Barclays say they see signals of euphoria among some investors. The strategists say a measure that tries to show how much “excess optimism” is in the market is not far from the peaks seen during the “meme stock” craze that sent GameStop to market-bending heights or to the dot-com bubble at the turn of the millennium. In other dealings early Wednesday, benchmark U.S. crude lost 8 cents to $65.37 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 3 cents to $67.08 per barrel. The U.S. dollar rose to 143.70 Japanese yen from 143.41 yen. The euro slid to $1.1787 from $1.1808."

Stablecoin Push Gains Ground in China in New Challenge to US,2025-07-02 13:00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stablecoin-push-gains-ground-china-040000819.html,"(Bloomberg) -- China faces growing calls from policy advisers and economists to explore using stablecoins for cross-border payments, as the US moves to entrench the dollar’s dominance through the still-emerging technology. Most Read from Bloomberg Struggling Downtowns Are Looking to Lure New Crowds Sprawl Is Still Not the Answer California Exempts Building Projects From Environmental Law What Gothenburg Got Out of Congestion Pricing While China hasn’t formally embraced stablecoins — digital tokens pegged to traditional currencies — and maintains a sweeping ban on crypto activities, recent remarks from senior central bank officials have given fresh momentum to discussions about their potential role in global payments. People’s Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng said in June that stablecoins could revolutionize international finance, particularly as rising geopolitical tensions highlight the fragility of traditional payment systems, which he warned can be politicized and used as a sanction tool. At the same Shanghai event, former central bank head Zhou Xiaochuan said dollar-linked stablecoins could facilitate dollarization. Other mainland and Hong Kong financial officials talked about the potential for yuan-based stablecoins to support China’s long-running effort to promote its currency on the world stage. Beijing has long been wary of cryptocurrencies, viewing them as a threat to financial stability and capital controls. But economists now see an opening, fueled in part by the Trump administration’s growing support for digital tokens. Morgan Stanley suggests China could use Hong Kong to trial offshore yuan-based stablecoins that would avoid violations of Beijing’s strict capital rules. “Stablecoins are not new currencies, but new distribution channels for existing ones,” said Robin Xing, chief China economist at Morgan Stanley. “It is crucial for China to embrace the trend of sovereign currency tokenization to maintain competitiveness in the digital infrastructure race.” Just hours before Pan and other Chinese officials spoke at the June 18 Lujiazui Forum, the US Senate passed a bill regulating stablecoins, in a major win for the crypto industry and a boost for President Donald Trump’s digital asset agenda. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a June 19 X post that stablecoins could strengthen — not threaten — the dollar’s dominance. Bessent told Bloomberg TV on Monday that global users are likely to favor US-backed stablecoins over central bank digital currencies from Europe or China, citing greater trust in the private sector under American regulation than the risk of government control elsewhere. Stablecoins, typically backed by traditional currencies and issued by private firms, are gaining traction as a faster, cheaper option for cross-border payments. Most are pegged to the dollar and backed by US assets like short-term Treasuries, with total supply projected to reach $3.7 trillion by 2030. In response, Chinese economists are urging the development of yuan-linked alternatives. “If China doesn’t develop stablecoins, it will essentially withdraw from the competition for next-generation global currency dominance and hand it to others,” said Shen Jianguang, chief economist at JD.com. JD.com founder Richard Liu reportedly told staff the company plans to apply for stablecoin licenses in all major markets to cut cross-border payment costs by 90% and reduce settlement time to under 10 seconds. Hong Kong has recently introduced its own regulatory framework for fiat-referenced stablecoins, offering licenses to issuers operating in the city. JD.com and Ant Group are among the first tech giants expected to apply. Shanghai-listed Zhejiang China Commodities City Group Co., operator of the world’s largest wholesale goods market, has also said it plans to seek a license. Offshore yuan stablecoins could help China take advantage of mounting global unease with dollar dominance, especially after it was used as a tool of financial pressure on the Kremlin following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Interest in the yuan is growing, with more than 30% of China’s goods trade settled in the currency in February, the highest in a decade, though its share in global payments remains modest. The growing interest in stablecoins comes as China’s own state-backed digital currency, the e-CNY, has struggled to gain traction both at home and abroad. A separate cross-border payments initiative, mBridge, is facing an uncertain future after a main participant, the Bank for International Settlements, pulled out over concerns it could be used to bypass sanctions. Pan recently announced plans for an international e-CNY center in Shanghai, signaling continued interest in promoting its use for trade. China should take a “dual track” approach to bolster the yuan’s global use, according to Li Yang, chairman of the state-backed National Institution for Finance and Development and a former PBOC adviser. That would involve continuing traditional efforts, such as expanding currency swaps and the yuan-based CIPS settlement system, while also leveraging Hong Kong’s financial institutions to promote offshore yuan-linked stablecoins. What Bloomberg Intelligence Says ... “Hong Kong’s stablecoins can become Beijing’s alternative to sidestep SWIFT, alongside the earlier adopted CIPS and mBridge.” They “could significantly advance the yuan’s global usage. The yuan’s adoption faces a setback — transactions via CIPS have yet to reach a critical mass.” — Francis Chan, senior banking and fintech analyst. Click here to read the full report. For now, stablecoins are mostly used for crypto trading instead of business payments, and regulators still need to address risks like fraud and financial crime. While many countries are exploring regulations, key questions remain, like whether stablecoins should be treated as currencies or financial assets. Ultimately, the global status of a currency is determined by the nation’s overall power and credibility, not a new means of payment, according to Liu Xiaochun, vice president of Shanghai Finance Institute. Chinese stablecoins may face limits without broader economic reforms, according to Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University professor and author of the book The Future of Money: How the Digital Revolution Is Transforming Currencies and Finance. “Yuan-linked stablecoins issued in Hong Kong are unlikely to gain much traction in the absence of unification of onshore and offshore exchange markets,” he said. But stablecoins, he added, could nudge Beijing toward change. By complicating exchange rate and monetary policy management, they might “serve as an incentive to undertake liberalization and market-oriented reforms,” he said.

Life Insurance Stocks Q1 Highlights: Unum Group (NYSE:UNM),2025-07-02 12:30:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/life-insurance-stocks-q1-highlights-033055262.html,"As the Q1 earnings season wraps, let’s dig into this quarter’s best and worst performers in the life insurance industry, including Unum Group (NYSE:UNM) and its peers. Life insurance companies collect premiums from policyholders in exchange for providing a future death benefit or retirement income stream. Interest rates matter for the sector (and make it cyclical), with higher rates allowing insurers to reinvest their fixed-income portfolios at more attractive yields and vice versa. Additionally, favorable demographic shifts, such as an aging population, are driving strong demand for retirement products while AI and data analytics offer significant opportunities to improve underwriting accuracy and operational efficiency. Conversely, the industry faces headwinds from persistent competition from agile insurtechs that threaten traditional distribution models. The 15 life insurance stocks we track reported a softer Q1. As a group, revenues missed analysts’ consensus estimates by 3.1%. In light of this news, share prices of the companies have held steady. On average, they are relatively unchanged since the latest earnings results.

Market Update As a result of the Fed’s rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has come down from frothy levels post-pandemic. The general rise in the price of goods and services is trending towards the Fed’s 2% goal as of late, which is good news. The higher rates that fought inflation also didn't slow economic activity enough to catalyze a recession. So far, soft landing. This, combined with recent rate cuts (half a percent in September 2024 and a quarter percent in November 2024) have led to strong stock market performance in 2024. The icing on the cake for 2024 returns was Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. Presidential Election in early November, sending major indices to all-time highs in the week following the election. Still, debates around the health of the economy and the impact of potential tariffs and corporate tax cuts remain, leaving much uncertainty around 2025.

Uber Freight Faces $9M Hit in Del Monte’s $1B Bankruptcy,2025-07-02 12:17:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/uber-freight-faces-9m-hit-031702809.html,"One of the Largest Food Shipper Bankruptcies in Years Del Monte Foods Corporation has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, listing more than $1 billion in liabilities and over 10,000 creditors. The case, filed in the U.S. District of New Jersey, ranks among the largest food shipper bankruptcies in recent years, given the company’s national footprint and brand portfolio. A Legacy Brand with National Reach Del Monte Foods reported $1.7 billion in U.S. revenue for fiscal year 2024. Its brand portfolio includes household names such as Del Monte canned fruits and vegetables, Contadina tomato products, College Inn broths, Joyba bubble tea, Kitchen Basics stocks, and S&W beans. These products are sold nationally through grocery, mass retail, and club channels. Freight, Warehousing, and Pallet Vendors Owed Millions Uber Freight (listed as Transplace, a company that Uber Freight acquired, in the filing) was listed as the second-largest unsecured creditor, owed over $9 million for managed transportation and freight brokerage services. Saddle Creek Logistics is owed $1.3 million for warehousing support, while CHEP USA has $470,000 in exposure tied to pooled pallet services. Under Chapter 11, these pre-bankruptcy amounts are classified as unsecured claims, placing them behind secured lenders and administrative expenses in repayment priority. There is no guarantee of full recovery, and outcomes typically depend on asset sales or court-approved reorganization plans. Possibility for Payment on Post-Filing Services While pre-petition balances remain at risk, logistics providers may be able to negotiate repayment for services rendered after the filing. These post-petition services—such as transportation, warehousing, or pallet pooling—may be granted administrative expense priority if approved by the court and funded under Del Monte’s debtor-in-possession (DIP) budget. DIP Financing Secured, Asset Sales on the Table Del Monte has secured $912.5 million in DIP financing, split between a term loan and an asset-based lending facility. The financing is led by Wilmington Savings Fund Society and JPMorgan Chase Bank. The company’s board has authorized the potential sale of “all or substantially all” of its assets, indicating that major brands or business units could be sold as part of the reorganization. Logistics contracts may be assumed, renegotiated, or terminated depending on how buyers choose to operate. Logistics Providers in a Transitional Position In Chapter 11 cases, transportation and warehousing vendors often continue playing a vital operational role while navigating uncertainty over unpaid balances. Post-filing services can be paid on a priority basis, but terms are typically subject to court oversight and tighter credit conditions.

Ford Stock Hits 7-Month High After Strong Sales Numbers—Watch These Key Price Levels,2025-07-02 11:46:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-stock-hits-7-month-024615557.html,"Source: TradingView.com Key Takeaways Ford shares jumped Tuesday after the automaker reported a 14% increase in U.S. sales in the second quarter. The price broke out from an ascending triangle on above-average volume, a chart pattern that signals a continuation of the stock's recent uptrend. Investors should watch major overhead levels on Ford's chart around $11.50, $13 and $13.60, while also monitoring a crucial support level near $10.30. Ford ( F ) shares jumped Tuesday after the automaker reported a big jump in U.S. sales and an increase in market share in the second quarter. The company said that sales rose 14.2% in the second quarter versus a year ago, as demand for pickup trucks and SUVs surged. Ford estimated that its market share grew 1.8 percentage points from the first quarter to 14.3%. The solid numbers come amid concerns about possible declines in new car sales over the coming months as manufacturers incorporate tariff costs into vehicle prices. When Ford released its first-quarter financial results in May, the company said it would not provide full-year earnings guidance amid uncertainty about the impact of tariffs. Ford shares have gained nearly 15% since the start of the year, handily outpacing the S&P 500 ’s 5% return over the same period. The stock rose 4.6% to $11.35 on Tuesday. Below, we take a closer look at Ford’s chart and use technical analysis to point out price levels that investors will likely be watching. Ascending Triangle Breakout After reclaiming the 200-day moving average in mid-May, Ford shares consolidated within an ascending triangle , a chart pattern that signals a continuation of the stock’s recent uptrend. Indeed, the price staged a decisive breakout above the pattern’s upper trendline in Tuesday’s trading session on above-average volume . Meanwhile, the relative strength index confirms bullish momentum, but remains below overbought levels, providing the shares with sufficient room for further upside. In another win for the bulls, the 50-day MA crossed above the 200-day MA late last month to form a golden cross , a bullish chart signal that points to the beginning of a new uptrend. Let’s identify three major areas on Ford’s chart worth watching if the shares continue tracking higher and also point out a support level to monitor during future pullbacks in the stock. Overhead Areas Worth Watching Further buying could see the shares test overhead resistance around $11.50. The shares may face selling pressure in this area near the May 2024 trough, which also closely aligns with a series of peaks that formed on the chart between August and November last year. The next higher area to watch lies at $13. This location may provide resistance near minor peaks that developed on the chart last year in March and April. A close above this area could drive a move toward $13.60. Investors who bought the stock at lower levels may look to lock in profits in this region near a range of prices situated just below the April 2024 high and an area that preceded last July’s prominent stock gap . This location also sits in the same neighborhood as a projected bars pattern bullish target that takes the stock’s move higher that preceded the ascending triangle and repositions it from the pattern’s breakout point. Crucial Support Level to Monitor During pullbacks in Ford’s stock, investors should keep an eye on the $10.30 level. This region could become a trading floor near the two key moving averages and a range of peaks and troughs that emerged on the chart between September and March.

BHP inks charter contracts with COSCO for ammonia dual-fuelled vessels,2025-07-02 11:40:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bhp-inks-charter-contracts-cosco-024043582.html,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Australia's BHP Group has signed contracts with China's COSCO Shipping for the charter of two ammonia dual-fuelled Newcastlemax bulk carriers, the mining giant said on Wednesday. The two vessels are expected to be delivered from 2028 and will be charted for five years. They will mainly be used to transport iron ore from Western Australia to Northeast Asia. These vessels can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50 per cent and up to 95 per cent on a per-voyage basis compared to a conventionally-fuelled voyage, if they run on lower or low-to-zero GHG emissions ammonia, according to BHP. The mining giant previously told Reuters that it plans to receive its first ammonia-fuelled bulk carrier from 2026 as part of the company's plans to cut shipping emissions. Ammonia is among several alternative fuels that shippers are exploring to cut carbon emissions, though adoption will take time to scale up. (Reporting by Jeslyn Lerh; Editing by Mrigank Dhaniwala)"

"Stocks inch up, dollar struggles under weight of Trump tariffs, Fed uncertainty",2025-07-02 11:16:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asian-stocks-waver-dollar-frail-021649292.html,"By Ankur Banerjee and Johann M Cherian SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Global stocks edged higher and the dollar was pinned near a three-year low on Wednesday as investors pondered the prospect of U.S. interest rate cuts and the scramble for trade deals ahead of President Donald Trump's July 9 deadline for tariffs. Trump said he was not considering extending the deadline for countries to negotiate trade deals with the United States, and cast doubts again that an agreement could be reached with Japan, although he expects a deal with India. The European Union's trade chief is also expected to hold negotiations this week in Washington to avert higher U.S. tariffs. Europe's STOXX 600 edged up 0.1%, and Germany's DAX climbed 0.3% in early trading. Across the Atlantic, futures tracking the S&P 500 pointed to a higher open after the benchmark index eased from its record high in the previous session. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan witnessed a choppy session earlier in the day and was last up 0.1%. However, trade ambiguities weighed on Japanese stocks that lost 0.5%. ""You've seen it with other trade negotiations that they take years if you want to do them properly,"" said Matthias Scheiber, senior portfolio manager and the head of the multi-asset solutions team at Allspring Global Investments. ""It's not something you negotiate within a week. I think that's also what the U.S. is realizing now. If the tariffs get ramped up again and the situation sours, short-term, we can definitely see some volatility."" Data on Tuesday showed the U.S. labour market remained resilient with a rise in job openings for May, sharpening the focus on the payrolls report due on Thursday as investors try to gauge when the Federal Reserve is likely to cut rates next. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, under fire from Trump to cut rates immediately, reiterated that the U.S. central bank plans to ""wait and learn more"" about the impact of tariffs on inflation before lowering interest rates. Traders are pricing in about 64 basis points of cuts this year from the Fed, with the odds of a move in July at 21%. The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against six rivals, hovered near its lowest since early 2022 and was last at 96.705. Analysts have said that any signs of labour market weakness could further weigh on the greenback. TRUMP'S BILL Investor focus over the last few days has pivoted to the progress of Trump's massive tax-and-spending bill, which is expected to add $3.3 trillion to the national debt, slash taxes and reduce social safety net programmes. The legislation heads to the House of Representatives for possible final approval after U.S. Senate Republicans passed it by the narrowest of margins. The bill has stoked fiscal worries, but the reaction was relatively muted in bond markets after it passed the Senate. Aninda Mitra, head of Asia macro strategy at BNY Investment Institute, said the legislation solidifies a steady deterioration of the fiscal position and the debt trajectory of the U.S. government. ""The near-term impact is mostly in the price, but the uncertainty factor could keep term premia elevated. We don’t think long-term yields will fall back materially in the 6-12 month horizon."" Uncertainties about the outlook on public finances, trade and interest rates have caused investors to flee U.S. assets and look for alternatives. This was evident in the U.S. dollar's 10% loss, its worst first-half performance since the 1970s. In commodities, spot gold slipped 0.2% to $3,331 per ounce, after surging 1% in the previous session. The yellow metal is up 27% this year on safe-haven flows. [GOL/] (Reporting by Ankur Banerjee and Johann M Cherian; Editing by Shri Navaratnam, Jamie Freed and Saad Sayeed)"
US Tells Court It Can’t Locate Man Wrongly Sent to El Salvador,2025-07-02 11:08:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-tells-court-t-locate-020835980.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration told a federal appeals court it has been unable to locate a man wrongly deported to El Salvador a week after a three-judge panel ordered that he be returned to the US. Most Read from Bloomberg Struggling Downtowns Are Looking to Lure New Crowds Sprawl Is Still Not the Answer California Exempts Building Projects From Environmental Law What Gothenburg Got Out of Congestion Pricing The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in New York directed the government on June 24 to return Jordin Alexander Melgar-Salmeron “as soon as possible” after officials said he was put on a flight to his native El Salvador on May 7 “due to a confluence of administrative errors.” Late Tuesday, a Justice Department attorney said in a letter to the court that Melgar-Salmeron’s “current physical location and custodial status are unknown,” but that efforts to locate him continue through diplomatic channels with El Salvador. The Washington office of Interpol, the international police network, is awaiting a response from counterparts in San Salvador as to whether criminal proceedings have been initiated against Melgar-Salmeron, according to the letter. He is the subject of an Interpol “red notice” because he’s been wanted by Salvadoran authorities since 2014 on charges of aggravated homicide and conspiracy over the alleged slaying of a rival gang member, according to the letter. The Trump administration promised to update the court if Melgar-Salmeron is found. But the government lawyer did not indicate that the administration will help the man return to the US, despite the court’s order, saying only that immigration authorities will “facilitate petitioner’s entry into the United States once he presents himself at the port of entry.” Melgar-Salmeron is at least the fourth person ordered by federal courts to be returned to the US. The government fought orders to bring back Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia from El Salvador, until last month when he was transported to Tennessee to face criminal charges that he illegally transported undocumented immigrants. Melgar-Salmeron was deported about 30 minutes after the appeals court ruled that he could not be taken out of the country, the court found. The Trump administration, which has faced opposition to its deportation campaign, has said that it is prioritizing the removal of criminals and other people who present a danger to the community. Melgar-Salmeron pleaded guilty to illegal possession of a shotgun and was sentenced to two years in prison in 2021. Melgar-Salmeron’s lawyer, Matthew Borowski, had no immediate comment. Borowski has said that his client had been affiliated with the MS-13 street gang, but left the group years ago and was working in construction. Melgar-Salmeron is married to a US citizen and has four children, he said. The case is Melgar-Salmeron v. Bondi, 23-7792, US Court of Appeals, 2nd Circuit. --With assistance from Patricia Hurtado.

Fed Chair Powell says he would've cut rates already if not for Trump's tariffs,2025-07-02 11:05:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-chair-powell-says-wouldve-020519658.html,"Reuters Fed Chair Jerome Powell says tariffs have prevented the rate cuts President Trump badly wants. The Fed remains in wait-and-see mode as it updates its inflation and economic outlook. Markets anticipate two rate cuts this year, but some predict no cuts at all. Fed Chair Jerome Powell effectively told President Trump on Tuesday that he's his own worst enemy in his crusade for rate cuts. He was speaking specifically about the tariffs Trump has announced and implemented, blaming them for the lack of rate-cut activity. ""We went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs ,"" Powell said at a European Central Bank panel. Keeping inflation in check is ultimately what the Fed is focused on when deciding whether to adjust interest rates. And while recent data has been fairly encouraging , the central bank remains on hold until the impacts of tariffs on the economy become clearer. In this case, uncertainty is the enemy. When asked if July was too soon to start cutting rates, Powell didn't offer a clear answer, instead reaffirming his wait-and-see position. Markets are currently pricing in just a 19% probability of a cut at the July 30 meeting, according to the CME FedWatch tool . ""It's going to depend on the data. We are going meeting by meeting,"" Powell said. ""I wouldn't take any meeting off the table or put it directly on the table."" The Fed chair's inaction on cutting rates has drawn the ire of Trump , and Powell's latest comments will no doubt add more fuel to the running feud . Trump has suggested firing Powell, and yesterday the president sending Powell a handwritten note demanding rate cuts. Trump has also reportedly considered appointing Powell's successor months in advance, effectively undermining the Fed Chair's authority . However, amid the Fed's wait-and-see messaging, Powell did offer a bit of clarity, saying that the majority of FOMC participants felt that it would be appropriate to begin cutting rates at some point during the remaining four Fed meetings this year. Markets are pricing in around two rate cuts for the rest of the year. Some strategists, such as Bank of America 's Senior US Economist Aditya Bhave, are predicting no rate cuts at all.

"Australia retail sales rise marginally in May, boost hopes for rate cut",2025-07-02 10:41:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/australia-retail-sales-edge-0-014125658.html,"By Stella Qiu SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australian retail sales barely grew for a fourth straight month in May as gains in clothing purchases were offset by a rare drop in food sales, bolstering the case for another cut in interest rates next week. The result dashed hopes that lower borrowing costs and rising real incomes would revive household demand, suggesting the Reserve Bank of Australia will have to again downgrade consumption forecasts, in a blow to the economic outlook. Investors now see a 96% chance for the RBA to cut its cash rate of 3.85% by a quarter-point next Tuesday as economic growth stays weak and inflation risks have faded. Retail sales rose 0.2% in May from April, when they were flat, Wednesday's data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed. That was short of market forecasts for an increase of 0.4% and marked the fourth month of sluggish spending. The sales of A$37.3 billion ($24.5 billion) were up 3.3% on a year earlier for the slowest annual pace since last November. The data follows a measure of Australian consumer sentiment for May that showed pessimists still outnumber optimists. Given the weakness in consumption, ANZ brought forward its next rate cut call to July from August. That means all four big Australian banks are tipping a cut next Tuesday. ""While 75 bp of easing in a relatively short time runs a risk of igniting a little more demand than might be desirable, the recent softness in retail trade means that is likely to be seen as a lower risk than waiting too long for consumer demand to lift,"" said Adam Boyton, head of Australian economics at ANZ. The RBA has cut interest rates twice since February as cooling domestic inflation gave scope to counter rising global trade risks. However, the economy barely grew in the first quarter as consumers stayed stubbornly frugal and government spending sputtered to a standstill. A tame inflation reading for May has also encouraged investors to lock in a quarter-point rate cut next Tuesday, which led to many economists bringing forward their rate cut call to July from August. Swaps imply rates will keep falling to a floor of 2.85%, taking it under most estimates of neutral. Wednesday's report showed food retail sales fell 0.4% in this year's first monthly drop, while spending in cafes and restaurants was flat. Spending on clothes grew 2.9% on winter buying, though that only followed a big drop the previous month. The retail survey, covering 35% of household consumption, will be replaced after July by the Monthly Household Spending Indicator series, which is much broader in scope. The next MHSI report is due on Friday. ""While we continue to see conditions improving thanks to lagged impacts from the cuts since February, recent disappointing data points to further cuts from the RBA to deliver more to boost the economy,"" said AMP economist My Bui. ""Our base case is for four more cuts in July, August, November and February."" ($1=A$1.5202) (Reporting by Stella Qiu and Wayne Cole; Editing by Edwina Gibbs and Clarence Fernandez)"
Oil prices little changed as expectations for OPEC+ increase weigh,2025-07-02 10:31:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-prices-little-changed-investors-013136032.html,"By Anna Hirtenstein LONDON (Reuters) -Oil futures were little changed on Wednesday as markets weighed expectations of more supply from major producers next month, a softer U.S. dollar and a mixed bag of economic and market indicators from the U.S., the world's largest oil consumer. Brent crude added 5 cents to $67.16 a barrel at 0745 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was flat at $65.45 a barrel. Brent has traded between a high of $69.05 a barrel and low of $66.34 since June 25, as concerns of supply disruptions in the Middle East producing region have ebbed following the ceasefire between Iran and Israel. Weighing on prices, sources said American Petroleum Institute data late on Tuesday showed U.S. crude oil inventories rose by 680,000 barrels in the past week at a time when stockpiles typically draw amid the summer demand season. ""Today's oil price moves are being pushed by the interplay of potentially rising OPEC+ supply, confusing U.S. inventory signals, uncertain geopolitical outlook, and macro-policy ambiguity,"" said Phillip Nova senior market analyst Priyanka Sachdeva. Planned supply increases by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies including Russia, know as OPEC+, appear already priced in by investors and are unlikely to catch markets off-guard again imminently, Sachdeva said. Four OPEC+ sources told Reuters last week the group plans to raise output by 411,000 barrels per day next month when it meets on July 6, a similar amount to hikes agreed for May, June and July. ""We are all talking about additional supply coming to the market, but the supply has not really hit the market,"" said Giovanni Staunovo, commodity analyst at UBS. ""Probably because it's being consumed domestically."" Saudi Arabia lifted shipments in June by 450,000 bpd from May, according to data from Kpler, its highest in more than a year. However, overall OPEC+ exports are relatively flat to slightly down since March, Staunovo said. He expects this to persist over the summer as hot weather drives higher energy demand. The greenback continued to weaken, falling to a 3-1/2-year low against major peers earlier on Wednesday. A weaker dollar tends to support oil prices, as it could boost demand for buyers paying in other currencies. U.S. non-farm payrolls data due on Thursday will shape expectations around the depth and timing of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in the second half of this year, said Tony Sycamore, analyst at IG. Lower interest rates could spur economic activity which would in turn boost oil demand. Official U.S. oil stockpile data from the Energy Information Administration is due Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. ET.

Intel's new CEO explores big shift in chip manufacturing business,2025-07-02 10:29:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-intels-ceo-explores-big-012932387.html,"By Max A. Cherney, Jeffrey Dastin and Stephen Nellis SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Intel's ( INTC ) new chief executive is exploring a big change to its contract manufacturing business to win major customers, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters, in a potentially expensive shift from his predecessor's plans. If implemented, the new strategy for what Intel calls its ""foundry"" business would entail no longer marketing certain chipmaking technology, which the company had long developed, to external customers, the people said. Since taking the company's helm in March, CEO Lip-Bu Tan has moved fast to cut costs and find a new path to revive the ailing U.S. chipmaker. By June, he started voicing that a manufacturing process that prior CEO Pat Gelsinger bet heavily on, known as 18A, was losing its appeal to new customers, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. To put aside external sales of 18A and its variant 18A-P, manufacturing processes that have cost Intel billions of dollars to develop, the company would have to take a write-off, one of the people familiar with the matter said. Industry analysts contacted by Reuters said such a charge could amount to a loss of hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars. Intel declined to comment on such ""hypothetical scenarios or market speculation."" It said the lead customer for 18A has long been Intel itself, and it aims to ramp production of its ""Panther Lake"" laptop chips later in 2025, which it called the most advanced processors ever designed and manufactured in the United States. Persuading outside clients to use Intel's factories remains key to its future. As its 18A fabrication process faced delays, rival TSMC's N2 technology has been on track for production. Tan's preliminary answer to this challenge: focus more resources on 14A, a next-generation chipmaking process where Intel expects to have advantages over Taiwan's TSMC, the two sources said. The move is part of a play for big customers like Apple and Nvidia, which currently pay TSMC to manufacture their chips. FILE PHOTO: Intel's CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, speaks in California Tan has tasked the company with teeing up options for discussion with Intel's board when it meets as early as this month, including whether to stop marketing 18A to new clients, one of the two sources said. The board might not reach a decision on 18A until a subsequent autumn meeting in light of the matter's complexity and the enormous money at stake, the person said. Intel declined to comment on what it called rumor. In a statement, it said: ""Lip-Bu and the executive team are committed to strengthening our roadmap, building trust with our customers, and improving our financial position for the future. We have identified clear areas of focus and will take actions needed to turn the business around."" Last year was Intel's first unprofitable year since 1986. It posted a net loss attributable to the company of $18.8 billion for 2024. The Intel chief executive's deliberations show the enormous risks - and costs - under consideration to move the storied U.S. chipmaker back onto solid footing. Like Gelsinger, Tan inherited a company that had lost its manufacturing edge and fell behind on crucial technology waves of the past two decades: mobile computing and artificial intelligence. The company is targeting high-volume production later this year for 18A with its internal chips, which are widely expected to arrive ahead of external customer orders. Meanwhile, delivering 14A in time to win major contracts is by no means certain, and Intel could choose to stick with its existing plans for 18A, one of the sources said. Intel is tailoring 14A to key clients' needs to make it successful, the company said. AMAZON AND MICROSOFT ON 18A Tan's review of whether to focus clients on 14A involves the contract chipmaking portion of Intel, or foundry, which makes chips for external customers. Regardless of a board decision, Intel will make chips via 18A in cases where its plans are already in motion, the people familiar with the matter said. This includes using 18A for Intel's in-house chips that it already designed for that manufacturing process, the people said. Intel also will produce a relatively small volume of chips that it has guaranteed for Amazon.com and Microsoft via 18A, with deadlines that make it unrealistic to wait for the development of 14A. Amazon and Microsoft did not immediately comment on the matter. Intel said it will deliver on its customer commitments. Tan's overall strategy for Intel remains nascent. So far, he has updated his leadership team, bringing in new engineering talent, and he has worked to shrink what he considered bloated and slow-moving middle management. Shifting away from selling 18A to foundry customers would represent one of his biggest moves yet. The 18A manufacturing process includes a novel method of delivering energy to chips and a new type of transistor. Together, these enhancements were meant to let Intel match or exceed TSMC's capabilities, Intel executives have previously said. However, according to some industry analysts, the 18A process is roughly equivalent to TSMC's so-called N3 manufacturing technology, which went into high-volume production in late 2022. If Intel follows Tan's lead, the company would focus its foundry employees, design partners and new customers on 14A, where it hopes for a better chance to compete against TSMC. Tan has drawn on extensive contacts and customer relationships built over decades in the chip industry to arrive at his view on 18A, the two sources said. (Reporting by Jeffrey Dastin, Max A.

"Dollar wallows near 3-1/2-year low as Fed easing, Trump bill in focus",2025-07-02 10:21:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dollar-wallows-near-3-1-012141318.html,"By Kevin Buckland TOKYO (Reuters) -The U.S. dollar hunkered near its lowest since February 2022 against major peers on Wednesday, as traders considered dovish hints from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, along with the potential impact of President Donald Trump's spending bill. The greenback was pinned near its weakest since September 2021 on the euro, and was close to its lowest since January 2015 versus the Swiss franc. Powell reiterated on Tuesday at the European Central Bank's annual conference in Sintra, Portugal, that the Fed is taking a patient approach to further interest rate cuts. But he did not rule out a reduction at this month's meeting, saying everything depends on incoming data. That raises the stakes for the monthly non-farm payrolls report on Thursday. Indications of labour market resilience in the U.S. JOLTS figures overnight saw the dollar rise off Tuesday's lows. The dollar index, which measures the currency against six major counterparts, edged up slightly to 96.744, but did not stray far from the overnight low of 96.373. Markets are also keeping a close watch on Trump's massive tax-and-spending bill, which could add $3.3 trillion to the national debt. The bill, which was passed by the U.S. Senate, will return to the House for final approval. ""The confirmation that this is an increase in issuance, an increase in government spending well beyond its means, is not necessarily good news for the Treasury market, and it's arguably one of the reasons the dollar's going down,"" said Rodrigo Catril, a strategist at National Australia Bank. Also weighing on the U.S. currency has been Trump's continued attacks on Powell, putting Fed independence in the spotlight. On Monday, the president sent the Fed Chair a list of global central bank key rates adorned with handwritten commentary, saying the U.S. rate should be between Japan's 0.5% and Denmark's 1.75%, and telling him he was ""as usual, 'too late.'"" The greenback held steady at 0.7917 Swiss franc, after dipping as low as 0.7873 franc in the previous session. The euro weakened slightly to $1.1791, but remained close to the overnight peak of $1.1829. Sterling was flat at $1.3739, sitting just below Tuesday's high of $1.3787, a level last seen in October 2021. The dollar made up a little ground against Japan's currency, adding 0.2% to 143.68 yen, following the prior session's 0.4% slide. ""My base case remains for the greenback to slowly but steadily grind lower over time, as confidence in the idea of monetary policy independence continues to be eroded,"" Michael Brown, a strategist at Pepperstone, wrote in a client note.

Japan’s Trade Strategy Tested as Trump Pushes for Quick Deals,2025-07-02 10:07:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/japan-trade-strategy-tested-trump-113043960.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s efforts to maintain a steady, friendly approach to trade negotiations are being tested as President Donald Trump ramps up pressure for a deal ahead of a looming tariff deadline. Most Read from Bloomberg Struggling Downtowns Are Looking to Lure New Crowds Sprawl Is Still Not the Answer California Exempts Building Projects From Environmental Law What Gothenburg Got Out of Congestion Pricing With higher US tariffs set to take effect on July 9, Tokyo’s cautious strategy has yet to deliver a breakthrough, raising the risk that it could become an easy target in the Trump administration’s push for fast wins. Unlike China, which has taken a more retaliatory stance to US pressure, Japan remains dependent on Washington for trade and security, leaving Tokyo with little appetite for direct confrontation. Instead, chief trade negotiator Ryosei Akazawa is likely to stick to his playbook of keeping talks frequent, polite and firm, not wanting to risk a bad deal with a national vote looming on July 20. “The government is stuck between US expectations and domestic pressure not to give up too much before the election,” said Rintaro Nishimura, an associate at The Asia Group. Trump has stepped up his rhetoric. He suggested Monday that across-the-board tariffs could end up much higher than the 24% penciled in for Japan on July 9. Japan should be forced to “pay 30%, 35% or whatever the number is that we determine, because we also have a very big trade deficit with Japan,” Trump said. “I’m not sure we’re going to make a deal. I doubt it with Japan, they’re very tough. You have to understand, they’re very spoiled,” Trump said. Those comments marked the third-straight day that Trump zoomed in on Japan in his comments on trade. He lambasted Japan for not buying enough US cars in an interview that aired Sunday, he followed up with a social media post singling out Japan for not importing US rice even when the nation is experiencing a shortage. Japanese officials have so far responded cautiously, trying not to inflame tensions. Akazawa — who’s made seven trips to Washington in recent months — may have had the most reason to be frustrated. On his latest visit, he didn’t get to meet Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and two of his three conversations with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick happened over the phone. “Most times I’m taking off from Haneda Airport without a confirmed schedule of meetings,” Akazawa said Tuesday on his return to Tokyo. Yet despite the hurdles, he projected confidence that repeated talks and relationship-building will eventually lead to a mutually acceptable deal. “We expect a package to span various fields and become quite extensive, so there are still points where the two sides are not on the same page,” he said. “We find both the reciprocal and sectoral tariffs unfortunate. So we won’t be able to say we have protected our national interests unless both of them are addressed.” Investors, for now, are keeping calm amid the trade negotiations. “The bark is worse than the bite,” said Rajeev De Mello, Geneva-based portfolio manager at Gama Asset Management SA. “I expect that the US will delay most of the excess tariffs but keep a 10% rate.” Japan’s Strategy Japan’s pitch to Washington has centered on jobs and investment, especially in the auto industry. Ishiba’s team is pushing to reduce a steep 25% tariff on Japanese cars and lower the planned across-the-board duties from 24% set to take effect on July 9. Tokyo is also offering cooperation on shipbuilding and increased spending on US semiconductors and liquefied natural gas as sweeteners. That jobs-first message has worked before. Trump dropped his opposition to Nippon Steel’s takeover of US Steel after Japan stressed its commitment to American workers. But a strategy that worked in the boardroom may not be enough to move the dial at the national level. “The message from the Trump administration is that it wants something big. The Japanese are patching things together and hoping that it sticks,” Nishimura said. The stakes are high for Tokyo. Japan’s auto industry accounts for nearly 10% of the country’s gross domestic product and employs around 8% of the workforce, making it a vital growth engine Ishiba is under pressure to defend. While some level of tariffs on cars seems inevitable, officials hope to bring them down closer to 10% to show progress at home. One option could be to open Japan’s rice market in exchange for concessions on cars. But that’s politically sensitive. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party has long relied on support from the farming sector to retain seats in rural areas, and any move seen as giving up the agricultural lobby to protect the auto industry would risk alienating that voting base. Akazawa has said Japan won’t sacrifice farmers in the trade deals. Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi said he will support talks that maximize the benefits for Japan. Japan will need to make broader gestures, such as removing non-tariff barriers on car imports and lowering duties on its agricultural products including rice, according to Kenichi Kawasaki, a professor at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies. Even then, he expects US car tariffs of about 10% to remain. Akazawa has chosen his words carefully as Japan navigates the looming July 9 trade deadline. While acknowledging the milestone, he has made clear Tokyo won’t be pressured into a deal it doesn’t want. Trump for weeks has sought to exert leverage with negotiating partners ahead of the deadline, vowing to cut short talks with those he sees as being difficult and instead send them letters setting tariff rates. Asked if Akazawa will quickly disclose to the media if a letter from Trump arrives, he smiled. “If it comes to that, I think you’ll find that President Trump will have announced it already on Truth Social,” Akazawa said. --With assistance from Umesh Desai and Gina Turner.

"Morgan Stanley is all-in on the 'buy America' trade, with one key exception",2025-07-02 09:52:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morgan-stanley-buy-america-trade-005244133.html,"Gabriel Pevide/Getty Images for Morgan Stanley Morgan Stanley maintains that the 'Buy America' trade is the best course of action for investors. The bank recommends going overweight US stocks, Treasurys and investment-grade corporate bonds. However, the firm says the fast-depreciating US dollar could have further to fall. "" Sell America "" has emerged as a popular rallying cry for market pundits who are balking at President Donald Trump's tax bill and wide-reaching tariff plan. But in its newest outlook, Morgan Stanley is taking the opposite approach, recommending a handful of US assets for the next 12 months. The firm is specifically focused on US stocks, Treasurys, and investment-grade corporate credit, recommending an overweight portfolio positioning for each. Even a complex and ever-changing macro environment isn't enough to challenge its view. ""Global growth is slowing, but macro is not the markets,"" Morgan Stanley wrote in recent research. The firm argued that riskier assets can rally in the face of slowing growth, while Treasury's can benefit from the multiple interest rate cuts the firm expects in 2026. The S&P 500 has shown this to be true, reaching new record highs at a time when the economy has been far from stellar . One driving force behind Morgan Stanley's US bullishness is a popular acronym: TINA, short for There Is No Alternative. ""There are few large, liquid equity or fixed-income markets that can match the US at the moment,"" the firm wrote. But there's one area Morgan Stanley sees depreciating further: the US dollar, which just capped off its weakest first half of the year since the Nixon administration. A combination of slowing economic growth, political uncertainty, and rising fiscal concerns have been largely responsible for the dollar declining versus global peers. ""The one notable US asset we dislike is the USD, which we think can depreciate significantly with US growth and yield differentials versus RoW fading,"" the firm said. Experts such as Mizuho's Vishnu Varathan have attributed pressure on the US dollar to factors such as the pending One Big Beautiful Bill , a budgetary package that threatens to significantly increase the US deficit by $3.3 trillion over the coming decade. ""An unsustainable debt path is a key motivator of the 'Sell America' narrative that has compromised USD and USD assets, Varathan said. Read the original article on Business Insider"
Trump Tariff Risks Put Asian Stocks’ Strong July Record to Test,2025-07-02 09:33:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-tariff-risks-put-asian-003329309.html,"(Bloomberg) -- A seasonal lift for Asian equities in July may be hard to come by this year as tariff and macroeconomic concerns dampen sentiment. Most Read from Bloomberg Struggling Downtowns Are Looking to Lure New Crowds Sprawl Is Still Not the Answer California Exempts Building Projects From Environmental Law What Gothenburg Got Out of Congestion Pricing Markets are bracing for heightened volatility ahead of the July 9 deadline for countries to cut trade deals with the US. Uncertainty over the outcome of these negotiations poses a hurdle for regional shares to maintain an average return of 1.36% for July — the second-best performing month of the year — over the past decade. Investors are “somewhat holding back on fresh allocations to emerging Asia,” said Christian Nolting, global chief investment officer at Deutsche Bank’s Private Bank. “While recent comments from high-level negotiators suggest constructive progress in ongoing talks with major Asian trading partners,” uncertainties remain high given that trade disputes during President Donald Trump’s first term lasted one and a half years, he added. While the MSCI Asia Pacific Index has gained for three consecutive months through June, a potential return of “Liberation Day” tariff rates could send shares plunging in a similar way they did in early April. Trump ruled out delaying the July 9 deadline for imposing higher levies on trading partners and renewed threats to hike tariffs on Japan. That saw Japanese shares leading losses in Asia early on Wednesday, with the Nikkei 225 down about 1%. Even if trade deals materialize, some levels of tariffs are likely to stay. That would be a drag on the region’s export-led economies. A number of central banks in Asia have lowered their growth outlooks for the year. Meanwhile, elevated US interest rates may curb the scope for Asian central banks to further lower borrowing costs. “The third quarter looks to have lots of dangerous potholes with higher inflation and the prospect of slower growth,” said Gary Dugan, chief executive officer of the Global CIO Office. “We are not so convinced the Federal Reserve will have sufficient reasons to cut rates at the pace the market prices.” To be sure, a milder-than-expected tariff outcome and more dovish signaling from the Federal Reserve may encourage flows into the region. Current positioning in Asian assets leaves room for upside, said Gary Tan, a portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments. The US central bank has refrained from cutting interest rates this year as it assesses the impact of Trump’s tariffs on inflation. The Trump administration though has been applying pressure to lower borrowing costs, and two Fed governors in recent days have said a cut could be appropriate as soon as July. The MSCI Asia Pacific gauge has risen 12% so far this year, outperforming the US, with shares in South Korea and Hong Kong seeing renewed interest. Still, some markets in Southeast Asia, where countries were hit with among the highest tariff rates, remain under pressure. “We continue to expect choppy markets over the summer,” Nomura Holdings Inc. strategists including Chetan Seth wrote in a recent note. “We recommend investors focus on stock selection and on idiosyncratic themes that provide insulation from policy uncertainty and ones that offer better visibility.” --With assistance from Abhishek Vishnoi.

Bain Capital is dreaming of Californication . The private equity giant is in talks to re-enter the music industry through a partnership with Warner Music . Its first target? The entire Red Hot Chili Peppers catalog, which could fetch more than $300 million, according to the Financial Times . If the purchase goes through, the deal would be part of a larger $1.2 billion partnership between Warner and Bain, with the intention of buying ""legendary music catalogs,"" according to a statement from Warner Music . Bain is re-entering the music industry after helping buy out Universal in 2004, an era maligned by online piracy. One driving force behind the collaboration is the resilient nature of music as an investment. This was even true during the COVID era, when music assets stayed ""rock solid"" and in some cases grew, Bain partner Angelo Rufino told the FT. Goldman Sachs agrees, at least when it comes to live music. In research earlier this year, the firm said concerts are more recession-resilient than other forms of entertainment.

Apple Stock Hits 6-Week High After Lagging Big Tech Peers in Q2—Watch These Key Levels,2025-07-02 08:47:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-stock-hits-6-week-234750337.html,"Source: TradingView.com Key Takeaways Apple shares bucked a broader downturn for technology stocks on Tuesday, rising for the third straight day to their highest level in six weeks. The rally to start the week follows a report that the iPhone maker could use OpenAI or Anthropic to power its Siri voice assistant. The stock broke out from a descending triangle and closed above the 50-day moving average in Monday's trading session, potentially setting the stage for an upside trend reversal. Investors should watch key overhead areas on Apple's chart around $214 and $235, while also monitoring support levels near $193 and $180. Apple ( AAPL ) shares bucked a broader downturn for technology stocks on Tuesday, rising for the third straight day to their highest level in six weeks. The rally to start the week follows a report that the iPhone maker could use OpenAI or Anthropic to power the next generation of Siri. The company, which has had delays rolling out the latest installment of its voice assisted technology, held talks with both companies about relying on their AI models instead of in-house technology, Bloomberg reported on Monday. Apple shares have faced downward pressure this year amid concerns the company is falling behind its big tech rivals on the AI development front. The stock fell nearly 8% in the second quarter, making it the only Magnificent Seven member to lose ground in the period. Since the start of the year, Apple shares have slumped 17%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 's 5% gain. On Tuesday, the stock rose 1.3% to around $208. Below, we take a closer look at Apple’s chart and use technical analysis to identify key price levels that investors will likely be watching. Descending Triangle Breakout Apple shares broke out from a descending triangle and closed above the 50-day moving average in Monday’s trading session, potentially setting the stage for an upside trend reversal . What’s more, the relative strength index confirmed strengthening price momentum, with the indicator registering its highest reading since late February. However, bears will argue that the stock remains in an established downtrend after the 50-day MA crossed below the 200-day MA back in April to form a "" death cross ,"" a chart signal pointing to lower prices. Let’s identify two key areas on Apple’s chart to watch if the stock moves higher and also identify support levels worth monitoring during potential retracements. Overhead Areas to Watch The first overhead area to watch sits around $214. This level may provide overhead resistance near the early-May peak, which also closely aligns with troughs that developed on the chart in March and September. A decisive close above this level could see the shares climb toward $235. Investors who have accumulated the stock at lower prices may look for exit points in this location near a trendline that connects a range of corresponding price action on the chart between July and March. Support Levels Worth Monitoring During retracements in the stock, it’s initially worth monitoring the $193 level. The shares could attract buying interest in this area near the descending triangle’s lower trendline. Finally, a convincing breakdown in Apple shares below the descending triangle could trigger a steeper decline to around $180. Investors may look for entry points in this region that align with a pullback to the 200-day MA in May last year following a prominent stock gap .

Figma files for IPO nearly two years after $20 billion Adobe buyout fell through,2025-07-02 08:11:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/figma-files-ipo-nearly-two-231113109.html,"About a year and a half after Adobe’s attempted $20 billion acquisition of design software unicorn Figma collapsed , Figma has taken a step towards a new future in the public markets. On Tuesday, when the company filed paperwork to go public on the New York Stock Exchange, in a prospectus larded with more than 200 references to AI, Figma set the stage for one of the most anticipated IPOs of 2025. The San Francisco-based company, which will trade under the ticker “FIG”, did not provide details of how much it expects to raise in the offering or the valuation it is seeking. But its S-1 filing comes at a moment when the market for venture-backed IPOs looks better than it has in some time, from the meteoric debuts of AI infrastructure company CoreWeave (up 290% from its IPO price) to the blowout triumph of stablecoin firm Circle (up 519%). As Figma moves to capitalize on the bullish conditions for new issuers, a key question for its venture investors and employees is whether it can top the $20 billion valuation that Adobe was prepared to pay for it before the deal fell through due to intractable regulatory resistance, particularly in the U.K. A tender offer that Figma organized last year for employees to cash out some shares, valued the company at $12.5 billion. And as investors chomp at the bit for opportunities to ride the AI wave, Figma must make the case that it can harness the power of generative AI to tap into new growth without itself becoming a victim of AI. “We’re already investing heavily in AI and we plan to double down even more in this area,” CEO and cofounder Dylan Field wrote in a “letter to investors” included in the prospectus. “AI spend will potentially be a drag on our efficiency for several years, but AI is also core to how design workflows will evolve going forward.” To judge by its S-1 filing, the design company’s business is growing robustly. In Q1 2025, Figma’s revenue increased 46% to $228.2 million from $156.2 million in Q1 2024, according to the filing. Likewise, in Q1 2025, Figma’s net income hit $44.8 million, a sharp increase from $13.5 million in Q1 last year. In 2024, Figma clocked net loss of more than $700 million, an anomalous byproduct of the Adobe deal’s fallout. The filing also revealed that Figma has 1,031 customers who put up more than $100,000 to the company’s annual recurring revenue, plus 11,107 customers who add more than $10,000 to Figma’s overall revenue. In 2024, Figma’s total revenue came in at $749 million, up year-over-year by 48%, the prospectus shows. Figma was founded in 2012 by Dylan Field and Evan Wallace, who met as students at Brown University. And the company is about as venture-backed as it gets, with many of Silicon Valley’s biggest VC names in the mix from its early days: Index Ventures led Figma’s $3.8 million seed round in 2013, Greylock led the company’s 2015 Series A, Kleiner Perkins led the 2018 Series B, Sequoia the 2019 Series C, and Andreessen Horowitz the 2020 Series D. Looking ahead, Figma’s plans to grow include growing its customer base and expanding its international footprint—more than half of the company’s revenue already comes from outside the U.S., the filing states. Acquisitions will also be key to Figma’s near-term future, Field wrote, telling prospective investors to “expect us to take big swings when we see a chance to invest in our platforms or pursue M&A at scale.” The company’s CVC arm, Figma Ventures, and its 18 investments to date also get a shoutout in the filing. Also in true Silicon Valley form and as is often the case for founder-led companies, Field will retain majority control of the company after the IPO, thanks to a special class of super voting shares, according to the S-1. Field currently has 75.3% voting power, including shares owned by cofounder Evan Wallace entrusted to him, though the filing did not specify what Field’s exact stake will be after the offering . In the prospectus, Field explained his rationale for going public at a time when “many amazing companies” are staying private for longer, citing liquidity, brand awareness, and the value of capital markets access. He added: “More importantly, I like the idea of our community sharing in the ownership of Figma—and the best way to do that is through the public markets.” This story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

Australia's Commodity Exports Face Headwinds,2025-07-02 08:00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/australias-commodity-exports-face-headwinds-230000423.html,"Australia has been out of luck lately. The country’s consumer watchdog just this week warned the east coast could face a gas shortage as soon as this year. Smelters and miners are complaining about high energy costs and asking for government help. And now the industry department is warning that commodity exports are about to weaken on trade headwinds. In a new report , the Australian Department of Industry, Science and Resources said it expected commodity exports to keep rising over this year and next, but income from them is set to weaken—because of lower commodity prices. The trend would be an extension of the decline in commodity export profits from the 2024/25 fiscal year, the department said. By the numbers, the Department of Industry, Science and Resources expects A$2 billion ($1.3 billion) lower profits from commodity exports for fiscal 2024/25, falling further by A$4 billion ($2.6 billion) in the current fiscal year that begins today, and moving lower still, by A$8 billion ($5.3 billion), in fiscal 2026/27. It seems the Australian government expects a consistent oversupply situation in most of its export commodities, citing growth in supply. For instance, iron ore supply globally is set to keep growing over the next two years, leading to consistently soft prices, affecting Australia’s export earnings. Iron ore accounts for as much as a quarter of the country’s total resource and energy commodity exports, so an impact on iron ore profits is an impact on total profits. Indeed, the industry department sees iron ore export profits sliding from A$116 billion in 2024/25 to A$105 billion in the current fiscal year and further to A$97 billion in fiscal 2026/27. In U.S. dollars, the decline is from $75.6 billion to $69 billion in 2025/26, and to $63.7 billion in 2026/27. Interestingly, over the longer term, it could be Australia itself contributing to the price decline trend. A new iron ore deposit was recently discovered in Western Australia that holds an estimated 55 billion metric tons of the basic metal, valued at some $6 trillion. The outlook for liquefied natural gas is not much better than the one for iron ore. According to the industry department, while it prepares for weaker iron ore prices, Australia’s commodity industry should brace for softer LNG prices as well. Again, the reason cited for the prediction is robust global supply. Most of that, according to analysts, is set to come from the United States but Canada just shipped its first LNG cargo from the Shell-led LNG Canada facility in British Columbia, so there will be non-U.S. supply growth as well, most likely. Related: The Quiet Comeback of Voluntary Carbon Markets Speaking of Shell, it is not even half as bothered about LNG demand, supply, and prices as the Australian government appears to be. In fact, Shell expects global LNG demand to rise by 60% by 2040, which should theoretically support reasonably healthy price levels for all producers. Coal, meanwhile, will remain a major contributor to Australia’s energy commodity earnings, despite the government’s determination to phase out hydrocarbons from the country’s energy system. Yet profits from thermal coal exports, the sort used in electricity generation, are expected to follow the decline in iron ore and LNG. One big reason for this may be China’s boost in domestic coal supply, which has reduced its demand for imported coal. Metallurgical coal exports, however, are seen remaining steady over the next two years, suggesting healthy demand from the metallurgical sector abroad. There are a couple of commodities that are enjoying stronger growth in demand than in supply, with profits from their exports set to rise substantially. One of them is gold, seen rising to the top third place among Australia’s commodity export profit contributors. The other is copper—exports are seen surging by 25% this fiscal year. These metals, it seems, are going to remain in strong demand even as iron ore falters.

3 things driving Robinhood's blistering 151% stock rally in 2025,2025-07-02 07:44:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-things-driving-robinhoods-blistering-224416265.html,"Spencer Platt/Getty Images Robinhood stock surged 151% in the first half of 2025. The latest spike came as the popular brokerage rolled out tokenized stock investing in Europe. Bullish retail investors and new offerings for users have propelled gains this year. Retail investing has exploded in popularity since COVID, which has been a major boon for one of the most popular day-trader brokerages: Robinhood . The company's stock was up 151% in the first half of 2025, a move capped by a 13% surge on Monday alone. Known as the favorite platform for everyday investors, Robinhood became well known during the GameStop short squeeze of 2021 and has retained its popularity since then, gaining popularity among new and aspiring traders. After going public in 2021, Robinhood stock initially struggled to garner momentum, demonstrating minimal returns through most of 2022 and 2023. However, late in 2024, it started trending upward and since then, has made significant progress. Now it ranks among the year's breakout stocks, rewarding the traders who stocked up on shares during its stagnate period. The company has ""pulled a full 'Robin Hood,' stealing Wall Street's skepticism and redistributing it,"" said Michael Ashley Schulman, CIO of Running Point Capital Advisors. Detailed below are three major reasons why the stock has been on such a tear in 2025. 1. Crypto expansion Robinhood's growing list of products has featured a further push into crypto. The stock spiked 13% on Monday to a fresh record high after the company announced the launch of US private-stock and ETF tokens in the EU . This marks a major step towards making privately held companies like OpenAI and SpaceX accessible to new investors via blockchain technology. Previously, access to these companies has been limited to insiders and extremely high net-worth individuals. The tokenization itself works as follows: the company creates and issues crypto coins or digital tokens that are represented as equity shares. This is done through the use of smart contracts. But there's a catch: these tokens have their own prices, and they may not match or even be completely correlated with the underlying stock. While Robinhood's recent expansion was into Europe, US users aren't able to access these features yet, and it remains unclear when it will be expanded to them. Felix Hartmann, a managing partner at Hartmann Capital spoke to Business Insider about Robinhood's decision and its positive implications. ""By adopting blockchain technology, Robinhood is horizontally expanding from a trading venue for Millennials and Gen Z into an end-to-end financial giant,"" he states. ""Betting on Robinhood is going long the convergence of fintech and Web3, executed by the team that culturally owns Millennial and Gen Z distribution."" 2. Retail remains bullish Whenever a trading-platform stock starts to surge, it's typically at least partially driven by high engagement from users. In Robinhood's case, retail investors have been highly active, helping spark consistent momentum. Robinhood isn't the only trading platform that has enjoyed a strong start to 2025. Charles Scwab was up 23% in the first half of the year, while Interactive Brokers rose 25%. However, both pale in comparison to Robinhood's performance and a key difference is the rival platform's strong retail following. Even as economic uncertainty has risen lately, retail traders have continued piling into the stocks they believe in, sparking momentum that has helped keep HOOD in the green. 3. Expansive new product offerings As retail traders have continued piling into Robinhood, the company itself has been busy. In May 2025, it announced the launch of a prediction-markets hub, offering investors exposure to a booming new market, one that CEO Vlad Tenev says that Robinhood will play a leading role in. The rise of betting markets has become a dominant market theme over the past year, as people have flocked to bet on everything from sporting events to political races and many other things. These events contracts enable users to profit from specific outcomes. ""Businesses and investors can use these markets to hedge against uncertain events and associated risks,"" the company announced in a policy statement. Robinhood is also expanding into the AI market. In March 2025, it announced Robinhood Cortex, a digital assistant powered by AI that is expected to provide users with more tools for trading and analysis, slated for release later in 2025.

Congress just greenlit a NASA moon plan opposed by Musk and Isaacman,2025-07-02 07:30:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/congress-just-greenlit-nasa-moon-223059200.html,"NASAs Artemis I Moon rocket sits at Launch Pad Complex 39B at Kennedy Space Center, in Cape Canaveral, Florida, on June 15, 2022. - NASA is aiming for June 18, for the beginning of the next wet dress rehearsal test of the agencys Space Launch System (SLS) at the Kennedy Space Center, with tanking operations on June 20. (Photo by Eva Marie UZCATEGUI / AFP) (Photo by EVA MARIE UZCATEGUI/AFP via Getty Images) | Image Credits:Eva Marie Uzcategui / Getty Images Legacy aerospace giants scored a win Tuesday when the U.S. Senate passed President Trump’s budget reconciliation bill that earmarks billions more for NASA’s flagship Artemis program. The $10 billion addition to the Artemis architecture, which includes funding for additional Space Launch System rockets and an orbiting station around the moon called Gateway, is a rebuke to critics who wished to see alternative technologies used instead. Among those critics are SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, who Musk proposed as the next NASA administrator. There’s no sign the souring relations between Musk and Trump are recovering. If Trump signs the bill, the fallout, which began after the president’s abrupt revocation of Isaacman’s nomination, will likely continue — if not escalate. Musk in particular has taken aim at the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket on the grounds that it is fully expendable. Unlike SpaceX’s family of rockets, which are all designed to be reusable, SLS is one-time use only. As Musk put it back in 2020 , that means “a billion dollar rocket is blown up” every time it is launched. Even that may have been an understatement; more recent figures from NASA’s watchdog put recurring production costs closer to $2.5 billion each. A total of around $24 billion has been poured into SLS production to date, funds that have primarily gone to a consortium of aerospace primes, including Boeing, L3Harris’ Aerojet Rocketdyne, and Northrop Grumman, which leads construction of the major rocket components. During his recent confirmation hearings with the Senate, Isaacman questioned the massive sums. He affirmed using SLS for the next two Artemis missions, but ultimately said he didn’t think the rocket was “the long‑term way to get to and from the moon and to Mars with great frequency.” Congress — and Trump, if he decides to sign the bill into law — have decided to press ahead. Around $4.1 billion of the $10 billion total added to the document will go toward additional SLS rockets for Artemis missions 4 and 5. Meanwhile, around $2.6 billion will go toward completion of the Gateway station. Notably, the president’s fiscal year budget request for NASA submitted in May proposed to “phase out the Space Launch System and Orion spacecraft after the Artemis III mission is complete.” This new funding flies in the face of that proposal, which was submitted before Musk and Trump’s public fallout in June. The new funding includes $700 million for a new Mars Telecommunications Orbiter, $1.25 billion for additional operation of the International Space Station, and $325 million to SpaceX for the development of a spacecraft to de-orbit the ISS at the end of the decade. (The total award for that de-orbit spacecraft is $843 million .)"

S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: Benchmark Index Ticks Lower After Two Days of Record Highs,2025-07-02 07:05:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/p-500-gains-losses-today-220521566.html,"Angela Weiss / AFP / Getty Images Investors are keeping a close eye on developments in Congress, where legislators aim to give final approval by the end of the week to a GOP tax and spending bill. Key Takeaways The S&P 500 slipped 0.1% on July 1, 2025, failing to extend its streak of record closes, as the Senate passed a sweeping tax and spending bill. Tesla stock moved lower as a public dispute between CEO Elon Musk and President Trump re-ignited. Shares of casino operators gained ground after regulators reported better-than-expected gaming revenue growth in Macau for June. Major U.S. equities indexes were mixed on the first trading day of the third quarter as the Senate narrowly passed a major tax and spending bill that includes significant tax cuts, reductions in health care and food assistance programs, and increases in national security spending. The S&P 500 slipped 0.1%, failing to build on a two-session stint of record-high closes. Underperformance from the communication and technology sectors pressured the Nasdaq, which fell 0.8%, while the Dow gained 0.9%. Shares of natural gas processing and transport firm The Williams Companies ( WMB ) dropped 6.5%, falling the most of any stock in the S&P 500. The downturn comes after the energy infrastructure company announced a shakeup in its executive suite, with Chad Zamarin, currently an executive vice president, stepping up as the new president and CEO, and chief executive Alan Armstrong transitioning to a new role as executive chairman of the board of directors. Axon Enterprise ( AXON ) shares declined 6.4% on Tuesday, receding from a record high posted in the prior session. Although the maker of the Taser and other law enforcement equipment posted strong year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter, the company is navigating cost pressure, with selling, general, and administrative costs also up significantly from a year ago. Tesla ( TSLA ) stock lost 5.3% as tensions resurfaced between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. The president accused Musk of reaping excessive benefits from electric vehicle subsidies, suggesting that the Department of Government Efficiency, formerly led by Musk, should review programs that have subsidized Musk's business ventures, which include rocket company SpaceX as well as Tesla. Shares of casino and resort operators pushed higher after regulators in Asian gambling hotspot Macau reported a year-over-year surge in gaming revenue in June . Shares of Las Vegas Sands ( LVS ) and Wynn Resorts ( WYNN ) both surged around 8.9%, notching the best performances in the S&P 500. MGM Resorts International ( MGM ) shares were up 7.3%. All three companies have significant exposure to Macau. The National Association of Realtors pointed to several provisions in the Senate's tax and spending bill that could be positive for the housing market, including an extension of the mortgage interest deduction and lower individual tax rates. Meanwhile, mortgage rates remain near their lowest levels in several months, reflecting optimism that the Fed could be on its way to resuming interest-rate cuts. Shares of Builders FirstSource ( BLDR ), the largest U.S. supplier of residential construction materials, jumped 8.8%. Packaging Corporation of America ( PKG ) shares were up 7.6% after the company announced an agreement to buy the containerboard business of the industrial packaging firm Greif for $1.8 billion. The deal includes two containerboard mills, located in Ohio and Virginia, with an annual production capacity of approximately 800,000 tons.

Figma moves closer to a blockbuster IPO that could raise $1.5B,2025-07-02 06:55:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/figma-moves-closer-blockbuster-ipo-215534035.html,"Image Credits:Haje Kamps / TechCrunch Figma publicly shared its financials Tuesday, inching the design software company closer to an IPO. And while this initial S-1 is missing details such as number of shares to be offered and what price, the regulatory filing provides the clearest view yet of its financial health — and potential. IPO experts Renaissance Capital estimate that Figma could raise up to $1.5 billion in this offering. If it does meet or exceed that, Figma’s IPO will match or beat CoreWeave’s, which raised $1.5 billion and has been the biggest tech IPO of 2025 so far . There are some reasons to believe that Figma could pull it off. Its financials are impressive, per the S-1 filing. The company brought in $749 million in revenue in 2024, a 48% jump from 2023. Figma’s revenue continued to rise in the first quarter of 2025 with 46% year-over-year growth. The company reported rolling 12-month revenue as $821 million, with a 91% gross margin. Figma’s profit is interesting, too. The company was profitable in 2023 and then swung to a giant loss of $732 million in 2023. But this was largely due to one-time expenses related to a major employee stock compensation event. (Figma issued 10.5 million stock options, with a strike price of $8.50 per share to eligible employees, it said.) By the fourth quarter of 2024, Figma reported profits again, as it did in Q1 of 2025. Figma has also calculated its total debt to be so negligible that it reports it has none. But again, this is a line item that needs to be filled in. The company, naturally, has a revolving debt line, and left room to update its total debt in association with that. We also don’t know yet if any of the executives or VCs will be selling shares. Major backers include Index, Greylock, Kleiner Perkins, and Sequoia. We do know that in 2024, executives took part of a big tender offer that allowed employees to cash out of shares. For instance, Figma co-founder CEO and chairman Dylan Field cashed out of $20 million worth of shares as part of that sale. The S-1 document made another interesting disclosure, about co-founder Evan Wallace, who left Figma in 2021, according to his website . Wallace is named in the documents as a co-founder. However, Figma says Wallace has given Field full voting rights and control over his shares. Wallace’s family trust holds about one-third of the super-voting rights Class B shares (15 votes per share, Figma says). All told, the S-1 discloses that Field, pre-IPO, controls about 75% of the voting rights. The financials certainly look like the kind of company that Wall Street and retail investors typically like to buy. The one black cloud, if you can call it that, is the rise of vibe coding/designing AI apps. Upstarts like Lovable are targeting Figma’s market and growing fast. Figma, though, has its own set of AI products as well. Figma acknowledges in the S-1 the risks of failing to stand out in a competitive AI industry. “While we have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments to integrate AI, including generative AI, into our platform, AI technologies are rapidly evolving and there can be no guarantee that our products will remain competitive as new AI technologies are developed, adopted, and integrated into software solutions,” the company says in the regulatory document."

During recent congressional testimony, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said it wasn’t “obvious” that lowering interest rates would reduce housing costs, arguing that a long-term supply shortage was the source of elevated house prices. Powell also warned that high housing costs may be around for a while, even after the Federal Reserve eventually lowers interest rates.

High mortgage rates have been a big problem for both home buyers and sellers, and some lawmakers and administration officials are asking whether it’s the Federal Reserve’s fault. Last week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell took heat from lawmakers and White House officials after the central bank held its federal funds rate for the fourth time this year. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle criticised Powell about how the higher-than-usual fed funds rate contributes to housing unaffordability. The federal funds rate influences interest rates on all kinds of personal loans. It can influence mortgage rates, but they do not move in tandem with the Fed's key benchmark rate as much as other types of loans. Mortgage rates have been elevated for several years, currently hovering around 6.8% . That's well above 2020 levels, when home borrowing costs fell below 3% and many people bought homes or refinanced during that time. Because of that, sellers are reluctant to list their homes and give up the low rate for a higher one, creating a “lock-in” effect for homeowners . “It's not obvious, though, that lower rates would lead to lower housing inflation, because, of course, that would increase housing demand. It would unlock people's low mortgages, but that creates both a buyer and a seller,” Powell said during his July 25 testimony to the Senate Banking Committee. When the Fed last cut rates, it dropped them by a percentage point in late 2024 . Mortgage rates briefly rose in the wake of the cuts and eventually settled near the same level as before the central bank took action. Mortgage Rates Are Just One Aspect of Affordability Mortgage rates aren’t the only thing contributing to high housing costs. Low inventory has pushed home prices higher in recent years : A Redfin report found that the median U.S. home price hit a record $396,500 during the month ending June 15. A long-term housing shortage in the U.S. started after the 2008 housing crisis, when builders slowed down production when demand dropped. That has created a housing market short nearly 4 million homes to meet demand, a Realtor.com study showed. In his recent congressional testimony, Powell resisted the idea that lower interest rates would lead to improvements in the housing supply and, thus, lower housing prices. “Once...short-term rates are down to normal, whatever the new normal level is, I think housing costs are still going to be high,” Powell said. “We're still going to be faced with high insurance costs and high material costs and labor shortages and all the things that keep driving housing prices up across the country.” Read the original article on Investopedia"
Design Platform Figma Files for IPO as Market for New Tech Listings Warms,2025-07-02 06:46:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/design-platform-figma-files-ipo-214620113.html,"SOPA Images / Contributor / Getty Images Figma’s launch comes after a string of tech IPOs have hit the market. Design software maker Figma on Tuesday filed for an initial public offering , becoming the latest tech firm to plan a trading debut as the market for new listings shows signs of heating up. Figma, which agreed to scrap a $20 billion merger with design software giant Adobe ( ADBE ) in 2023, said it plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker symbol “FIG,” according to its prospectus filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company in its filing did not say how many shares it plans to sell in the IPO or the price at which it intended to sell them. The company plans to use the proceeds of its IPO to pay down debt, the filing said, as well as for working capital and, potentially for acquisitions. Figma offers creative tools for app and web interfaces and counts some of the world’s most valuable tech companies, including Amazon ( AMZN ), Google parent Alphabet ( GOOGL ), Oracle ( ORCL ), and Netflix ( NFLX ), among its customers. The company reported first-quarter net income of $44.9 million on revenue that jumped 46% year-over-year to $228.2 million. It was reportedly valued around $12.5 billion in a tender offer last year.

Traders’ Fear of Missing Out on Stock Gains Outweighs Tariff Concerns,2025-07-02 06:46:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/traders-fear-missing-stock-gains-184018252.html,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump’s tariff pause is set to end on July 9, with few deals locked in and scant progress in negotiations. Yet the stock market that once swung wildly on trade headlines appears to see little risk, as equity indexes sit near all-time highs and volatility evaporates. Most Read from Bloomberg Struggling Downtowns Are Looking to Lure New Crowds Sprawl Is Still Not the Answer California Exempts Building Projects From Environmental Law What Gothenburg Got Out of Congestion Pricing What gives? In part, the calm is being fueled by expectations that Trump will extend his tariff deadline based on his pattern of threatening harsh measures and subsequently backing down, a strategy analysts and strategists call “TACO” for “Trump Always Chickens Out.” But more importantly, Wall Street pros see no sense in fighting the market’s momentum as the economy remains healthy and Corporate America appears to be taking trade policies in stride — at least for now. “There’s still some focus on July 9, but so many other factors are being watched these days, too,” said Michael Kantrowitz, chief investment strategist at Piper Sandler & Co. “Once again, investors are less worried. In the absence of a spike in rates, inflation or the unemployment rate, stocks will continue to grind higher.” The S&P 500 Index just closed out its best quarter since December 2023 and cleared the 6,200 level before dipping back below on Tuesday and ending the session down 0.1%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index had its best quarter since March 2023 as the stock market’s usual leaders are taking their place at the front of the line again. Both posted losses in the first quarter. Meanwhile, traders have amped up their allocations to the market’s riskiest corners. Even institutional investors, who mostly stayed put for much of the 25% upswing since April, are gradually moving off the sidelines. And options data shows that Wall Street isn’t concerned about substantial volatility anytime soon. Smart Money In “Trade deals of some kind are likely to come, and underneath, earnings estimates have stabilized after falling in the immediate aftermath of April,” Steven Chiavarone, senior portfolio manager and equity strategist at Federated Hermes, said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Monday. “What started out as just a relief rally is starting to become something real, and that’s what sucks those investors in — slowly and reluctantly.” The S&P 500’s double-digit surge from its April 8 trough just before Trump paused his tariffs has largely been driven by retail investors. Now, the so-called smart money is starting to buy in as the rally shows few signs of stopping. Systematic strategies last week ratcheted up their exposure to equities, though they still remain underweight, with positioning in most sectors below the historical average, according to data compiled by Deutsche Bank AG’s Parag Thatte. Markets have priced out 84% of macroeconomic risk, based on an assessment by Piper Sandler’s Kantrowitz of high-yield credit spreads, leaving room for stocks to move even higher despite the S&P 500 adding more than $10 trillion in value since early April. The optimism has defied war in the Middle East, uncertainty around the macroeconomic outlook, and a lack of clarity on trade. “We were pretty bullish for June on things that have nothing to do with Trump — this just has to do with the fact there’s other stuff going on that’s quite positive,” said Alexander Altmann, global head of equities tactical strategies at Barclays Plc. The strategist cited bank deregulation, big tech firms’ continued spending on artificial intelligence, and Trump’s $3.3 trillion tax and spending bill as factors bolstering the economy. The Senate passed the bill on Tuesday in a 51-50 vote with Vice President J.D. Vance casting the deciding ballot. But it could still face resistance in the House of Representatives. Of course, none of this is to say that the risks facing the market have gone away. Even if Trump extends his tariff pause, there are other levies that are likely to raise expenses for companies or consumers — or both. Tempered Enthusiasm “We’re still going to end up with high tariff rates and absorb that cost at some point in the future,” Altmann said. “This is a market where it’s very hard to look and trade more than four weeks ahead right now. And it’s very hard to have a strong opinion on events that could or could not happen six months from now.” The way things stand, exporting nations without a bilateral accord in place by July 9 will face tariffs Trump presented on April 2, ones that are much higher than the current baseline 10% so-called reciprocal rate applied to most countries. The UK has locked in a deal that reduced some proposed levies but kept the reciprocal rate in place and left unresolved one of Britain’s pain points — 25% duties on steel. The US and China finalized a trade understanding reached in Geneva, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said last week, but described it as far from comprehensive and with key questions remaining. And Trump has threatened to ramp up tariffs on Japan. “We don’t have any significant trade deals — we have some memorandums of understanding, we have some agreement to move forward, but we don’t have anything concrete,” said Kate Moore, chief investment officer of Citigroup Inc.’s wealth unit. “I’ve been surprised, to be very honest with you, that the market seems to not care about it. It’s one of the reasons why this doesn’t feel like a fundamentally-driven market, despite the fact that we see a lot of strength in technology and artificial intelligence.” At the same time, JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s trading desk says the setup is bullish, projecting a streak of all-time highs as earnings carry positive momentum with trade deals expected to be announced. Andrew Tyler, the bank’s head of global market intelligence, is looking out for the June nonfarm payrolls report due Thursday. As long as it remains above 100,000, he expects stocks to keep logging fresh records. A survey by Bloomberg of economist estimates sees it coming in at 110,000. “For now, the market will look through those potential events,” Tyler wrote in a note to clients on Monday, referring to trade turbulence. “Further, we think the July 9 date gets rolled to avoid any market volatility.” --With assistance from Matt Turner.

What could happen to Sean 'Diddy' Combs' wealth? Experts weigh in.,2025-07-02 06:37:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-happen-sean-diddy-combs-213704242.html,"The jury in the Sean “Diddy” Combs trial completed their second day of deliberations on Tuesday, weighing a verdict that could not only put the rapper and business mogul in prison but also strip Combs of a sizable share of his wealth. The jury in Manhattan federal court is debating whether Combs is guilty of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking and two counts of transportation for the purposes of prostitution, all of which Combs has denied. Combs’ vast portfolio features multi-million-dollar mansions in Los Angeles and Miami, a private jet, high-priced art and private investments, among other holdings, including his Bad Boy Entertainment business assets, which include his Bad Boy Records label. Last year, before Combs was indicted but after his Los Angeles and Miami homes were raided by federal agents and the video of him physically assaulting former girlfriend Cassie Ventura came to light, Forbes estimated Combs’ net worth at $400 million, which marked a sharp decline from the outlet’s estimate in 2019 of $740 million. The federal government could seize some of Combs’ assets if he’s found guilty and a conviction would increase the likelihood of success for potential civil suits, some experts told ABC News. If Combs is acquitted, they added, he likely would risk losing some income due to the stigma attached to information that was disclosed at trial. MORE: Sean 'Diddy' Combs trial updates: Jury foreperson sends note claiming issue with juror Here’s what to know about how the Combs trial could impact his wealth, according to legal experts who spoke with ABC News. What could happen to Combs’ wealth if he’s found guilty? When federal prosecutors unsealed their indictment against Combs in September, the allegations called for the forfeiture of Combs’ assets in the event of a conviction. Referencing a charge of racketeering conspiracy against Combs, for instance, prosecutors said they would seek all assets “acquired or maintained” in violation of the law. An attempt to seize assets is fairly common when prosecuting racketeering conspiracy charges, also known as RICO cases, Kenworthey Bilz, a law professor at the University of Illinois, told ABC News. If prosecutors proved that Combs’ private jet was used to transport sex workers or clients, for example, the asset could be seized, Bilz said. Assets unrelated to the alleged crime, however, couldn't be touched. “The government would have to prove that assets were used to further the enterprise,” Bilz said. In the event of a conviction, Combs’ punishment could also include financial penalties and a requirement that he pay restitution to some victims, Nikos Passas, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at Northeastern University, told ABC News. “Whenever you have a very wealthy person convicted of this sort of crime, you’re going to have huge implications,” Passas said. “There’s serious damage that he’s done and he has the deep pockets to cover it.” Combs could also face additional payouts as result of potential civil lawsuits, which would prove more likely to succeed after a criminal conviction, the experts said. In criminal cases, prosecutors must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. In civil suits, however, prosecuting attorneys need only establish a preponderance of evidence, meaning they must show it’s more likely than not that a defendant committed the offense. “A criminal conviction on some or all charges would certainly bolster civil claims against Diddy,” Clark Neily, senior vice president for legal studies at the Cato Institute and professor at the University of Texas School of Law, told ABC News. What might happen to Combs’ wealth if he’s acquitted? If acquitted, Combs will avoid the immediate financial penalties that would otherwise arise from the criminal case, as spelled out in the indictment, but he would remain exposed to potential civil lawsuits as well as possible lost income due to his damaged reputation, the experts told ABC News. “For a high-profile artist and performer like Diddy, reputation is currency,” Jeff Apruzzese, professor of the music industry at Drexel University, told ABC News. “For him, right now, that currency is devaluing pretty fast.” MORE: Prosecutors rest their case against Sean 'Diddy' Combs after calling 34 witnesses Combs could face greater challenges booking venues and establishing endorsements or corporate partnerships, Apruzzese said. Even more, Apruzzese added, Combs will face difficulty garnering invites to award shows and signing new artists to record deals, limiting his alternate pathways to income. In 2021, singer R. Kelly – whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly – was convicted on nine counts, including racketeering charges tied to the sexual exploitation of children and was sentenced to 30 years in prison. While Kelly was found guilty, the outcome serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of preserving one’s reputation in the music industry, Apruzzese said, adding that “R. Kelly’s revenue pretty much dried up completely after everything that happened."" David B. Allan, a professor of music marketing at St. Joseph’s University, said many fans may turn away from Combs regardless of the verdict – and they’ll take their spending power with them. “I think the jury of public opinion has already decided, and they to a large extent feel like he’s guilty of something that they don’t approve of,” Allan said."
"Biggest US banks hike dividends, announce share buybacks after acing stress tests",2025-07-02 06:31:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biggest-us-banks-hike-dividends-213145188.html,"By Nupur Anand and Niket Nishant NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. banking giants announced plans on Tuesday to raise their third-quarter dividends after clearing the Federal Reserve's annual health check last week. The moves come after the lenders showed they have enough capital to withstand scenarios including a severe economic downturn, spiking unemployment and market turmoil. JPMorgan Chase, the nation's largest bank, raised its dividend to $1.50 a share from $1.40, according to a regulatory filing. It also announced a new $50 billion share repurchase program, effective on Tuesday and with an unspecified end date. ""The board’s intended dividend increase, our second this year, represents a sustainable level of capital distribution to our shareholders and is supported by our strong financial performance,"" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said. ""The new share repurchase program provides the ability to distribute capital to our shareholders over time, as we see fit,"" Dimon said, adding that the stress test shows that banks are resilient. Separately, Bank of America will raise its dividend by 8% to 28 cents per share, while Wells Fargo increased it to 45 cents a share from 40 cents, they said in separate filings. Morgan Stanley's board has approved a new $20 billion share repurchase program without specifying an end date and also plans to raise its quarterly dividend to $1 per share. Goldman Sachs' dividend will climb to $4 from $3, while Citigroup's will go up to 60 cents from 56 cents. On average, the Fed's stress test found banks retained an average 11.6% ratio of their common equity Tier 1 capital, well above the 4.5% minimum required by regulators. The nation's six largest banks all retained double-digit capital ratios under the test. The Fed is in the process of overhauling the way the test is conducted. The regulator proposed in April that the results should be averaged over two years, which could lead to less volatility in outcomes. ""The Federal Reserve has expressed its intention to institute a more transparent and fair approach to these tests, as it looks to uphold the safety and soundness of our financial system,"" Goldman CEO David Solomon said. JPM's Dimon also said that the new stress testing models could provide more transparency. That rule-writing project is still ongoing, but the central bank said on Friday that if the 2025 and 2024 results were averaged, banks would have needed to set aside more capital to meet the requirements.

Corona beer maker Constellation Brands misses quarterly estimates amid tariff woes,2025-07-02 06:12:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/corona-beer-maker-constellation-brands-211211555.html,"(Reuters) -Constellation Brands missed first-quarter sales and profit estimates on Tuesday, as fears of rising tariffs and economic uncertainty prompted consumers to reduce purchases of beers and wines. U.S. alcoholic beverage makers have faced a double blow from the Trump administration's shifting trade policies, a challenge that comes at a time when the industry is already grappling with tepid demand. Corona beer maker reported net sales of $2.52 billion for the quarter ended May 31, compared with analysts' average estimate of $2.55 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. Tariffs on beer imports, along with the inclusion of beer cans under aluminum tariffs, have impacted liquor makers such as Constellation Brands and Molson Coors. Last month, U.S. President Trump announced plans to double tariffs on imported steel and aluminum to 50% from 25%, intensifying pressure on global steel producers and escalating the trade war. Meanwhile, Constellation Brands has experienced a significant slowdown in beer consumption, particularly among its Hispanic consumers, following Trump's immigration crackdown. The company's beer business, its largest revenue contributor, reported a 2.6% decline in quarterly depletion volume — the rate at which products are sold — driven by declines in brands such as Modelo Especial and Corona Extra. Its beer depletions rose 6.4% a year ago. Sequential price increases and cost management measures were offset by higher expenses, including increased costs from aluminum tariffs and marketing expenditures. The company's quarterly operating margins at its beer business fell 150 basis points to 39.1%. Constellation reported comparable profit of $3.22 per share for the quarter, below estimates of $3.31. Shares of the company, which maintained its annual enterprise organic sales and profit forecast, were marginally lower in extended trading.

DOGE now targeting SEC policy, eyes SPAC rules, sourcessay Sweeping US fiscal bill moves ahead, rate path stays murky President Donald Trump's U.S. fiscal bill took a key step forward on Tuesday, carrying with it possible risks and rewards for investors. The legislation, narrowly passed by the U.S. Senate, would extend Trump's 2017 personal and business tax cuts, otherwise due to expire at the end of this year, and give new tax breaks in areas such as tipped income and overtime. Investors hope the tax easing might provide stimulus that supports consumer spending. But, according to nonpartisan analysts, the bill would add an estimated $3.3 trillion to the nation's debt. Growing deficits are continuing to cloud financial markets, especially after Moody's cut America's pristine sovereign credit rating in May. The bill still must pass the House of Representatives, where Trump's Republican party holds a slim majority, and it remains to be seen if it will become law by Trump's hoped-for deadline of the July 4 Independence Day holiday. Focus was also on the Federal Reserve, and when the U.S. central bank may next cut interest rates. At a central bank gathering in Portugal, Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated the need to understand the impact of Trump's tariffs on inflation before lowering rates. But Powell also declined to rule out a possible rate cut at the Fed's July 29-30 meeting. Markets also seemed to include such a possibility: Fed Fund futures were baking in a roughly 20% chance of a cut at the July meeting, with chances deemed much more likely at the Fed's September meeting. The rate path could become more clear with economic data in coming days, including the monthly U.S. jobs report on Thursday. The dollar, which has fallen steeply this year, edged lower against a basket of major currencies. In a mixed day on Wall Street, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq pulled back from record high levels, while another major U.S. index, the Dow Jones industrial average, moved closer to a record peak. A 5% drop in Tesla shares weighed on the Nasdaq and S&P 500. Trump threatened to cut off subsidies for companies run by Tesla chief Elon Musk, escalating tensions between the one-time allies who have since fallen out. Musk, who spent hundreds of millions on Trump's re-election, had renewed his criticism of the fiscal bill, which would eliminate subsidies for electric vehicle purchases that have benefited Tesla. Tesla shares could get another jolt on Wednesday when the EV carmaker releases its quarterly delivery figures. What could move markets tomorrow? * ADP national employment report (June) * Challenger job cuts data (June) * ECB forum on central banking * Euro zone unemployment rate (May) * Japan monetary base (June) * Tesla quarterly deliveries Opinions expressed are those of the author.

Euro Runs Its Best Winning Streak in Two Decades Versus Dollar,2025-07-02 06:02:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/euro-cusp-best-winning-streak-094625836.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The euro notched its longest winning streak against the dollar in more than two decades — and options traders are betting the rally isn’t over yet. Most Read from Bloomberg Struggling Downtowns Are Looking to Lure New Crowds Sprawl Is Still Not the Answer California Exempts Building Projects From Environmental Law What Gothenburg Got Out of Congestion Pricing The greenback’s recovery earlier in the day pressured the common currency, leading it to curb its advance after it touched the highest level since September 2021 earlier in the session. It’s the longest stretch for the euro since 2004, eclipsed only twice since the currency’s inception in 1999. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index advanced to a session high after Donald Trump’s $3.3 trillion tax and spending cut bill passed the Senate. It was also gaining after the first of this week’s reports on US labor market conditions failed to provide justification for a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut as soon as next month. The index later traded slightly weaker. “I think the knee-jerk reaction was to buy the dollar on lower fiscal policy uncertainty,” said Win Thin, global head of markets strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. “To me, pushing through a massive tax cut will eventually widen the budget deficit, which is ultimately dollar-negative.” The common currency traded 0.2% up at $1.1806 on Tuesday. Its recent rapid advances pushed options traders to ramp up bullish positioning. So-called risk reversals — a closely watched measure of market sentiment — posted the third-strongest bullish repricing of the year last week. Data from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation show that nearly two out of three options in the past week targeted a stronger euro. The euro’s rally has been underpinned by a long-running slide for the dollar, with fresh momentum from weaker US data and growing conviction that the Fed is preparing to ease policy more aggressively than the European Central Bank. According to Danske Bank AS strategists led by Jens Naervig Pedersen, the dollar’s structural decline has resumed as geopolitical risks fade and focus returns to the US economy and political backdrop. “We see many reasons to be short USD right now, including the possibility of a new Fed Chair being appointed earlier than expected,” he said. All currencies in the Group of 10 climbed against the greenback this year. The euro has risen nearly 14% against the greenback in the period, one of the top performers together with the Swiss franc, while a dollar index has fallen more than 9%. “Trump’s trade tariff risks to inflation have hindered the Fed’s ability to cut rates and this means the Fed likely has more easing to do than most of the rest of G-10 central banks,” analysts at MUFG, including Derek Halpenny, wrote in a note. “Given the euro gains and seeing limited risk for any notable correction lower, we see the $1.20-level now as very achievable later this year.” Analysts increasingly see the euro rallying toward $1.20 in the coming months. Strategists at Societe Generale SA, including Kit Juckes, expect the common currency to peak at around $1.25 over the medium term, even if it lags the yen and some Asian peers in the second half of the year. European Central Bank Vice President Luis de Guindos said Tuesday that while a move to $1.20 is “acceptable,” further gains would make policymakers’ task more complicated. What Bloomberg Strategists Say “While a mild strengthening of the currency doesn’t pose a particular concern for the ECB, gains that are too rapid tend to tighten financial conditions and may threaten to crimp economic growth.” — Ven Ram, Macro Strategist, Dubai. Click here for the full piece. For Nicholas Wall, head of Global FX Strategy at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, the ECB is doing the right thing by embracing a euro that’s attracting more demand as a reserve currency. “A stronger euro is good for Europe partly in the context of rising oil prices,” he said. Euro Hits Strongest Since 2014 Against Yuan as Rally Continues The latest euro-area inflation data offered little reason for the ECB to alter its stance. Consumer prices rose in France and Spain but held steady in Italy and unexpectedly eased in Germany, reinforcing the central bank’s view that inflation will converge sustainably toward its 2% target. --With assistance from Naomi Tajitsu.

Bismuth: The Next Critical Metal Supply Squeeze,2025-07-02 06:00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bismuth-next-critical-metal-supply-210000528.html,"Unless you are a hobbyist or technician who solders things on a regular basis, your only acquaintance with the metallic element bismuth is probably through Pepto Bismol, the main ingredient of which is bismuth subsalicylate, a pinkish substance sold, not surprisingly, under the name of pink bismuth. The fact that you can ingest pink bismuth and it will soothe your stomach should tell you something about its toxicity; it's quite low. And, that's why bismuth is  favored over lead for soldering. It is now widely used for soldering of circuit boards and other electronic equipment, lens production for high precision equipment, alloys with low melting points (for example, in automatic sprinklers to activate them when fire breaks out) and, of course, pharmaceuticals. All of those products are at risk as supplies of bismuth have dwindled. Those of you who read my pieces regularly can almost surely guess who is holding those supplies back. It's China. Bismuth is one of five metals on which China placed strict export limits back in February . Now those restrictions are beginning to bite. Early this year the price of bismuth shot up from $6 per pound to $40 per pound in Europe and $55 per pound in the United States. The price has since eased and is now being quoted at $17.50 per pound in Europe . That's still three times above the price earlier in the year. Why does China have so much market power? China controls 80 percent of the bismuth supply in the world . Bismuth metal exports from China have plunged more than 93 percent since the restrictions were put in place. The United States is especially vulnerable. It stopped producing bismuth domestically in 1997 . The trouble with mineral deposits is that they are not evenly distributed across the globe. That truism have been brought into focus by this year's export restrictions imposed by China which has an embarrassment of riches when it comes to critical metals. The old neoliberal idea is that it does not matter where commodities and manufactured products are extracted or produced. Trade will allow the most efficient producers to supply the world...that is, until those producers decide not to for political reasons. Related: U.S. Battery Makers Declare National Emergency After China’s Antimony Ban That is the emerging new world trade order, the arrival of which the Trump administration has hastened through its aggressive tariff policy, but one which was already coming into view before the current administration took office. We know this because China has reduced exports of critical materials before . And, the United States has for over a decade restricted export of advanced technologies to China , a strategy which the Biden administration built on after the first Trump administration embraced it. Well, it turns out it does matter where commodities and manufactured goods come from. If they come from a country you are increasingly at odds with, you better figure out how to become less dependent by finding other sources or developing your own, preferably before you get cut off. PS. I know that the United States and China have just agreed to further ease trade tensions in a notoriously vague agreement —the details of which have yet to be released—that appears to allow increased shipments of critical minerals. But in the murky, zigzag world of Trump administration trade policy, we should not be quick to judge the content nor the longevity of such an agreement. In any case, the long-term problem of China's domination of critical metals markets and its ability to cut off supplies whenever it wishes will not be solved.

Silicon Valley investor Vinod Khosla predicts AI will replace 80% of jobs by 2030—and take much of the Fortune 500 with it,2025-07-02 05:58:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/silicon-valley-investor-vinod-khosla-205800150.html,"Tech entrepreneur and investor Vinod Khosla ’s prediction of AI automating 80% of high-value jobs by 2030 coincides with a reckoning for Fortune 500 companies. Khosla shared his predictions for the future in a wide-ranging interview on the Uncapped With Jack Altman podcast . As a venture capitalist and early investor in companies like Square and Instacart , Khosla offered advice for business leaders on navigating unprecedented changes ahead. Companies like Sears and Toys “R” Us collapsed under digital pressure, but Khosla warns the 2030s will see a “faster demise” of giants as AI rewrites industry rules. See below for an overview of Khosla’s major predictions for AI, the economy, and more. Key takeaways Era of unprecedented disruption: Khosla describes the current technology cycle as “crazy and frenetic,” stating, “I’ve never seen a cycle like this…almost every job is being reinvented, every material thing is being reinvented differently with AI as a driver.” He compares the scale of change to the 1960s, noting, “We’re going to see this large change in such a short time, it’s almost hard to imagine how society adjusts.” AI and the end of work: Khosla predicts, “Within the next five years, any economically valuable job humans can do, AI will be able to do 80% of it…80% of all jobs can be done by an AI.” He believes by 2040, “the need to work will go away. People will work on things because they want to, not because they need to pay their mortgage.” Disruption of the Fortune 500: He forecasts a dramatic acceleration in the demise of large incumbent companies: “One of my predictions is the 2030s will see a faster rate of demise of Fortune 500 companies than we’ve ever seen…that transition won’t happen from existing companies. Somebody new will reinvent this.” Predictions by sector Health care: “If all medical expertise is free…you have an unlimited number of primary care doctors, oncologists, gastroenterologists, mental health therapists…how would you redesign the health care system?” Khosla argues that entrenched interests and regulatory barriers will slow—but not stop—AI-driven transformation . Robotics: He predicts that “almost everybody in the 2030s will have a humanoid robot at home…probably starting with something narrow like doing your cooking for you.” The main bottleneck is not hardware, but intelligence. Energy: Khosla is “very bullish about energy,” especially fusion and super-hot geothermal, which he believes could make power “cheaper than natural gas.” Advice for entrepreneurs Societal and geopolitical implications: Khosla warns of the risks of authoritarian regimes using AI for both hard and soft power: “By 2040 the biggest risk we might face…is China using [types of] AI—cyber AI, warfare AI—but also socially good AI, like free doctors to everybody on the planet…to embed their political philosophy.” Philosophy on venture and innovation: Khosla emphasizes founder-driven innovation: “Innovation only—I can’t think of very many large examples where large innovation came from somebody who was large or in the business…experts are terrible at predicting the future; they extrapolate the past. Entrepreneurs invent the future they want.” On risk and impact: “Most people reduce risk to increase the probability of success. I do the opposite: Start with [the] high consequences of success. I don’t care about the probability of failure.” Disclaimer: For this story, Fortune used generative AI to help with an initial draft.

You locked in a low mortgage rate — now you want to move. What should you do?,2025-07-02 05:55:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/mortgages/article/selling-your-house-when-you-have-a-low-mortgage-interest-rate-205501072.html,"That sweet, low mortgage rate was a matter of pride when you bought your current house. Now, it feels more like a prison. You want to move or need to relocate. However, higher mortgage rates are locking you into your home. There are several options for homeowners who want to move in today’s market. Some allow you to keep your rate and move, some help you snag another low interest rate, and others help you gain financial leverage before selling your home . The best choice will depend on your financial situation and stage in life. Learn more: 3 tips for selling your home in today’s market Rent out your home to keep your low-rate mortgage Jake Krimmel, a senior economist with Realtor.com, said in a video interview with Yahoo Finance that a ""lock-in effect"" keeps homeowners from selling. ""It's about mortgage rates for existing homeowners versus what they can get out there on the market. Those numbers are still out of whack,"" Krimmel added. ""It is certainly changing people's behaviors in ways that we haven't seen in the past, which has ramifications for inventory, for transactions, and why we're still in this holding pattern."" In fact, Kimmel is feeling the lock-in effect himself: ""I'm locked in at 2.75% right now. I'm moving to New York, but we're going to rent our house out."" That's a solution you might consider, if you can swing it: Keep your existing house and, hopefully, cover the mortgage and a little more by renting it out. With that rental income, you may be able to qualify for another mortgage on your new home. Your existing low mortgage rate will help you pay off the loan sooner and enjoy the benefits of passive income. Being a landlord has its own challenges and expenses, though, so you may want to consider a management company to get some professional advice and handle the burden — for a fee, of course. Read more: Will mortgage rates ever be 3% again? Recast your mortgage for a lower monthly payment If you don't want to rent out your existing home, here's a strategy to soften the blow of incurring a higher interest rate on your new place. It's a loan product that allows you to buy your next house before you sell your current home — and then lower your monthly payment on the new house. It's called a mortgage recast . Here's how it works: You get a mortgage on your new home. Once your old home sells, you pay off the previous mortgage. Then, apply the cash equity left over to the loan for your new home. The lender will recalculate your monthly payments based on your lower loan balance. An example: You buy your next home for $450,000. With a 20% down payment and a 30-year fixed mortgage at 6.5%, your monthly payment is $2,275 on the $360,000 loan. When you sell your old home and pay off your mortgage, you have $100,000 left over, which you apply to the principal balance of your new home loan. Your recast mortgage payment is $1,643. Not all lenders will recast a mortgage, and in this instance, you will have to qualify for two mortgages until your original home sells. Most conventional loans can be recast; however, government loans, such as FHA, VA, and USDA mortgages, cannot. Up Next Where and how to find the lowest mortgage rates right now When will mortgage rates go down to 4%? Capital gains tax on real estate: How much you'll pay when you sell a home Look for an assumable mortgage This will be a long shot, but you need to know it's out there. Assumable mortgages allow you to take over the loan of someone with a low-interest mortgage when you buy their house. These are usually government home loans , namely FHA, VA, and USDA loans. There are a few hurdles, though: Assumable loans aren't that easy to find. Not all mortgage lenders want to deal with them. You'll need to come up with a chunk of cash to pay the existing owner the difference between the sale price and the mortgage balance. You’ll also still need to cover closing costs . Negotiate a rate buydown One way to get a lower mortgage rate on your next house is to look for a rate buydown . Some lenders offer these promotional loan programs, in which your rate is lowered for a year or two and then reverts to the regular loan rate. Current buydown offers are available from national lenders like New American Funding and Guild Mortgage . Home builders often use buydowns to attract buyers to their new subdivision developments. Learn more: The best mortgage lenders right now A dream solution for keeping your low mortgage rate that's not available in the U.S. Here's another home loan twist that sounds too good to be true. Unfortunately, we have found no evidence that it's available in the United States. Yet researchers said it could be a powerful tool to unlock the U.S. real estate market. It's called a portable loan. Available in Canada and the United Kingdom, porting a mortgage allows you to sell your house and move your existing loan to your new home. You keep your existing loan terms and interest rate. Why aren't portable loans available here? The U.S. mortgage industry is a complicated web of state and federal regulations. It funds itself with investments tied to loans, and the system relies on a mortgage being paid off when a property is sold. Could it be done? Possibly. The state of Maine has worked on a plan to enable portability and ""promote housing affordability."" So it can be done. Maybe. Meanwhile, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which administers mortgage market makers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, told the New York Times that porting mortgages is ""not under active consideration."" Wanting to move with a locked-in low rate FAQs What are loan options for lower mortgage rates? Shorter loan terms may be an option for home buyers looking for lower rates. Shop 20- and 15-year fixed-rate mortgages. You may find a decent rate break from 30-year terms. Adjustable-rate mortgages may also offer a lower initial loan rate, but the rate will change periodically — up or down. Is moving from a low-rate mortgage a mistake? Life decisions are often more than a matter of choosing the best financial option. If your reason for relocating is for a new job or evolving family situations, you may have little choice. However, it is important to consider your priorities. If the move is more of a ""want"" than a ""need,"" perhaps it can be delayed until you have more financial options or real estate market conditions are more favorable. What is a good option to save my home's low mortgage rate rather than move? If you are moving for lifestyle reasons rather than a necessary relocation, consider making your current home more suited to your current needs. You may have sizable equity in your home that can be tapped by a home equity line of credit (HELOC) to add rooms, install upgrades, and construct amenities like a pool or outdoor kitchen.

Road to Battlefield: Central Eurasia’s gateway to TechCrunch Startup Battlefield,2025-07-02 05:41:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/road-battlefield-central-eurasia-gateway-204137474.html,"Image Credits:TechCrunch Historic regional competition launches to showcase Central Eurasia’s rising startup ecosystem on Silicon Valley’s biggest stage. For the first time in its history, Central Eurasia will have a direct pathway to TechCrunch Startup Battlefield through the launch of “Road to Battlefield,” a groundbreaking regional competition that promises to put the underrepresented region firmly on the global innovation map. The competition, organized by Silkroad Innovation Hub in partnership with TechCrunch and Freedom Holding, will span nine countries across Central Eurasia: Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Tajikistan, Türkiye, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. National competitions will lead to a regional final where the top three startups will earn spots in TechCrunch Startup Battlefield 2025 in San Francisco. “We’ve been exhibiting startups at TechCrunch Disrupt for several years as partners — 14 startups in 2023, 24 startups in 2024 — and we see that they can be competitive,” said Asset Abdualiyev, CEO and founder of Silkroad Innovation Hub. “In 2024, we had the largest pavilion at TechCrunch Disrupt. We are happy to take our partnership with TechCrunch Disrupt to the next level by providing direct access to TechCrunch Startup Battlefield 200 to the most promising startups from the Central Eurasian region.” A region ready for recognition Central Eurasia’s startup ecosystem has been quietly building momentum, representing a dynamic tech hub of 100 million people with one of the youngest populations in the world. The region produces approximately 200,000 STEM graduates annually and is home to an estimated 7,000 active startups across key sectors, including AI, fintech, edtech, medtech, and e-commerce. The numbers tell a compelling story: Venture funding in Central Asia and the South Caucasus has grown 5.5x in recent years, reaching $110 million in 2023 and $150 million in the first half of 2024 alone. Notable successes include AI company Higgsfield, valued at over $100 million, and Uzum from Uzbekistan, which raised $114 million in funding, becoming the country’s first unicorn with a valuation of $1.16 billion. Meanwhile, regional offices of global players, such as Telegram and inDrive, have established operations in Kazakhstan. Despite this growth, the region’s potential remains largely untapped by global investors. The Road to Battlefield competition aims to change that narrative by providing unprecedented visibility and access to Silicon Valley’s most influential networks. “Not all investors understand how vast the opportunities are in that region,” explained Abdualiyev. “This competition is about showcasing that Central Eurasia has startups that deserve global recognition.” The initiative has garnered strong support from key regional players. Magzhan Madiyev, CEO of Astana Hub in Kazakhstan, emphasized the importance of this opportunity: “We’ve been helping startups scale in the US through our acceleration programs and have seen real progress. Many companies have already secured local investments, and this competition provides an even bigger platform for Kazakhstan’s startups to be exposed.” Strong regional partnership The competition benefits from a robust partnership network across the region, supported by leading regional innovation hubs and accelerators: Astana Hub (Kazakhstan); IT Park Uzbekistan (Uzbekistan); Future Laboratory (Georgia); Sabah Hub and Innovation and Digital Development Agency (IDDA)  (Azerbaijan); IT Park Mongolia (Mongolia); Accelerate Prosperity (Kyrgyzstan); IT Park Dushanbe (Tajikistan); and Startup Centrum (Türkiye). IT Park Uzbekistan, one of the key supporters, sees this as a crucial step in ecosystem development. “We are happy to support and help Uzbek startups scale globally,” said Abdulakhad Kuchkarov, CEO of IT Park Uzbekistan. “We wish that through our efforts to evolve the venture ecosystem, our startups can be seen in the US market and expand globally. As part of the Central Asia Innovation Hub that we are now implementing with Astana Hub, this initiative aligns perfectly with our regional development goals.” The initiative is backed by Freedom Holding as the main partner, demonstrating significant private sector commitment to regional innovation. “Freedom Holding Corp. has been supporting Central Eurasian teams on the global TechCrunch stage for several years now, and this year is no exception,” said Marlen Sikhayev, adviser to the president of Freedom Finance Global PLC. “We believe in the potential of regional entrepreneurs and want to give them access to best practices, mentorship, and investments. This initiative not only provides crucial support for startups but also demonstrates that Central Eurasia’s technology and innovation sector is keeping pace with global trends and developing as a unified region.” Competition structure and timeline The competition follows a carefully structured process: Stage 1: National Competitions (July 21 – August 10) . Each country will host online pitch events. Stage 2: Regional Final (August 15) . The top 20 startups will compete in an online regional final to determine the three winners.

"Samsara Beyond event highlights AI’s impact on fleet safety, efficiency",2025-07-02 05:35:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/samsara-beyond-event-highlights-ai-203559513.html,"SAN DIEGO – Key takeaways from the Samsara Beyond event after customer interviews, press conferences and facility tours is the growing use of artificial intelligence in physical operations to improve safety and efficiency. Safety and security was a chief concern for Samsara customers, who in a recent panel ranged from agriculture, chemical distribution and food service. Each had various types of fleets paired with a complex multi layered internal supply chain, requiring telematics and machine learning to improve efficiency. At a press conference following Samsara’s keynote, industry leaders from Nutrien Ag Solutions, Univar Solutions and Sysco discussed how Samsara’s AI-powered platform has transformed their transportation operations. A common theme was customers using real-time data, geofencing and driver coaching to reduce accidents and improve efficiency. Customer panel testimonials praise safety and efficiency gains (Photo: Samsara) Univar Solutions talked about how safety is a cornerstone of their operations. The company operates in environments where noise and hazardous materials pose constant risks, including handling hazardous materials or high-value cargo. Rob McRae, vice president of transportation at Univar Solutions, highlighted the stakes, telling journalists, “Our operations can involve a dangerous environment — 150 feet away, you can’t hear over the noise, yet it’s critical to stay safe. We’re dealing with hazardous materials, and accidents can happen. Safety is our top priority, adding layers of protection to ensure our employees get home safely.” Nutrien Ag Solutions, using Samsara’s technology, saw a major reduction in incidents since adopting the platform three years ago. Springs said, “We’re seeing consistent increases in safety metrics.” The improvement also extends to community safety and transparency. “Samsara’s platform helps us meet that obligation through technology and proactive safety measures,” Springs added. Beyond safety, customers spoke of how Samsara’s platform streamlines operations through real-time data and automation. For Nutrien Ag Solutions, the adoption of Level Monitoring, which provides visibility into gas, solid, and liquid levels across a range of tank types, brought about added benefits. Springs described the labor-intensive process of manually checking tank levels: “Historically, checking tank levels required manual effort — climbing ladders, using side gauges, or other methods to determine product levels. This was time-consuming, especially for tanks spread across a 100-mile radius.” Samsara’s solution eliminates these inefficiencies. “We can get notifications when tanks reach a certain level, allowing us to dispatch efficiently without unnecessary trips,” Springs said, noting that this saves hours and provides better transparency into levels, which can help them better serve their customers while giving them a competitive advantage. (Photo: Samsara) Univar Solutions, which manages a private fleet of 1,000 vehicles, also talked about the benefits of dispatch and maintenance tools. McRae described some features: “Samsara’s dispatch tool integrates driver hours, vehicle maintenance, and operational data into a single platform, providing high-level dashboards for executives and tactical tools for dispatchers.” Faster dispatching allows Univar Solutions to handle last-minute loads more efficiently. McRae praised the maintenance tool, saying, “It provides intuitive data to validate repair costs — say, a $700 air brake replacement — against market rates, ensuring cost efficiency.” Sysco was another example of using technology to boost safety and efficiency. Sysco used the Samsara platform to put tech driven safety as part of its cultural framework. Kevin Thomas, vice president of global EHSS and asset protection, told the audience, “From a culture standpoint, safety is central to our identity. Two years ago, we engaged our more than 70,000 employees to create our safety tagline, ‘Safety is Our Main Ingredient,’ and introduced our safety mascot, ‘Shellbert,’ an egg symbolizing care…Samsara’s platform helps us show employees that leadership prioritizes their safety, fostering a culture where everyone goes home safe,” Thomas said. This focus has an added benefit to driver retention. Thomas noted, “Key indicators for us are reducing safety incidents and the financial impact of claims. While we always aim to improve these metrics, it’s not just about numbers — it’s about caring for our people.” Thomas also noted a significant reduction in incident rates after partnering with Samsara. Univar Solutions’ McRae echoed the cultural impact, he talked about how Samsara AI Dash Cams capture positive driver behaviors for recognition on their internal platform, “The Hub.” “These videos are the most-clicked content on The Hub, driving engagement and creating a flywheel effect for safety,” McRae said. Branch locations that used to have inconsistent safety records now show extended periods without incidents following the driver coaching deployment. AI tackles cross-border challenges from safety to security (Photo: Thomas Wasson/FreightWaves) To showcase the tech in action, Samsara held a closed event open to the press at a Mex-Cal Truckline terminal. For San Diego-based Mex-Cal Truckline, geofencing and asset tracking are critical for managing their fleet. Javier Rogel, chief innovation officer at Mex-Cal Truckline explained, “Our geofences are essential for managing 700 trailers with just two people. Alerts notify us if a trailer overstays at a customer’s yard — after three days, we charge $25 per day.” This system ensures prompt equipment recovery and supports Mex-Cal’s leasing operations. “We’ve tried other GPS solutions, but they’re costly and less reliable. Samsara is high quality and recognized in the market, giving us an edge when leasing trailers,” Rogel added. Mex-Cal Truckline’s operations also highlight the complexities of cross-border logistics with cargo security. Yvette Guillen, chief customer officer, spoke of one example telematics is helping, the company’s Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (CTPAT) certification: “This certification and Samsara’s technology are critical investments for our cross-border operations.” The company faces additional challenges, including keeping cargo safe from theft as it moves between various facilities between the border. Samsara’s geofencing mitigates risks like cargo theft, prevalent in high-risk areas like Tijuana. “Cargo theft is a major concern at the border. If a truck stops for more than 30 seconds, Samsara sends an alert,” Rogel explained. “We review camera footage for suspicious activity and may request U.S. Customs to x-ray the truck.” This added layer of security, supported by dual-facing AI dash cams and asset gateways, ensures compliance with clients like large North American automakers, who mandate CTPAT standards for carriers wishing to haul their shipments. Mex-Cal Truckline has also leveraged Samsara AI Dash Cams to address driver safety. Guillen reported a significant reduction in accidents following adoption. Often, the biggest low hanging fruit is driver distraction from cell phone use. Guillen talked about how in 2023 the company saw a spike in accidents, but by 2024 they reduced their DOT accident rating from features like real-time alerts that warn drivers to put down their phones. After identifying the behavior, the next step was helping drivers break the habit. Guillen added, “The alerts prompt drivers to correct behaviors on their own, reducing the need for office coaching. Drivers want to stay on the road, so they adapt quickly to avoid violations.” Looking ahead, AI is just getting started (Photo: Thomas Wasson/FreightWaves) Based on conversations with customers and tech providers while at the event, expect to see continued improvement in fleet safety and efficiency as AI adoption rates increase. Samsara leaders noted that for AI itself, the sky is the limit. They noted AI solves practical problems, whether customer notifications of delayed deliveries, automatic tracking links or coaching drivers based on event analysis. AI is also expanding into maintenance, processing invoices and optimizing labor, freeing up customer capacity. Samsara remains focused on giving customers leverage without rushing automation. The company notes that AI is about enabling better outcomes, not replacing people. Customers have seen a measurable impact on their safety and operations. “The details matter—our customers’ real-world results show the impact of our technology. We encourage everyone to try our products and see the difference. We’re excited about the future, from AI to partnerships, and we’re committed to solving problems for our customers in a practical, impactful way,” said Sanjit Biswas, co-founder and CEO of Samsara.

Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) Misses Q2 Revenue Estimates,2025-07-02 05:34:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/constellation-brands-nyse-stz-misses-203406135.html,"Beer, wine, and spirits company Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) missed Wall Street’s revenue expectations in Q2 CY2025, with sales falling 5.5% year on year to $2.52 billion. Its non-GAAP profit of $3.22 per share was 2.3% below analysts’ consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy Constellation Brands? Find out in our full research report . Constellation Brands (STZ) Q2 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $2.52 billion vs analyst estimates of $2.55 billion (5.5% year-on-year decline, 1.5% miss) Adjusted EPS: $3.22 vs analyst expectations of $3.29 (2.3% miss) Adjusted EBITDA: $829.7 million vs analyst estimates of $950.5 million (33% margin, 12.7% miss) Management reiterated its full-year Adjusted EPS guidance of $12.75 at the midpoint Operating Margin: 28.4%, down from 35.4% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow Margin: 17.7%, up from 11.8% in the same quarter last year Organic Revenue fell 4% year on year (6% in the same quarter last year) Market Capitalization: $28.78 billion Company Overview With a presence in more than 100 countries, Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) is a globally renowned producer and marketer of beer, wine, and spirits. Revenue Growth Reviewing a company’s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. With $10.06 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Constellation Brands is one of the larger consumer staples companies and benefits from a well-known brand that influences purchasing decisions. However, its scale is a double-edged sword because there are only a finite number of major retail partners, placing a ceiling on its growth. For Constellation Brands to boost its sales, it likely needs to adjust its prices, launch new offerings, or lean into foreign markets. As you can see below, Constellation Brands’s 3.2% annualized revenue growth over the last three years was sluggish. This shows it failed to generate demand in any major way and is a rough starting point for our analysis. Constellation Brands Quarterly Revenue This quarter, Constellation Brands missed Wall Street’s estimates and reported a rather uninspiring 5.5% year-on-year revenue decline, generating $2.52 billion of revenue. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to decline by 6.6% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last three years. This projection doesn't excite us and implies its products will face some demand challenges. Today’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next . Organic Revenue Growth When analyzing revenue growth, we care most about organic revenue growth. This metric captures a business’s performance excluding one-time events such as mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures as well as foreign currency fluctuations. The demand for Constellation Brands’s products has generally risen over the last two years but lagged behind the broader sector. On average, the company’s organic sales have grown by 2.8% year on year. Constellation Brands Year-On-Year Organic Revenue Growth In the latest quarter, Constellation Brands’s organic sales fell by 4% year on year. This decline was a reversal from its historical levels. We’ll keep a close eye on the company to see if this turns into a longer-term trend. Key Takeaways from Constellation Brands’s Q2 Results The company's revenue and EPS both missed, which is a poor start. However, Constellation Brands did maintain its full-year revenue guidance. Still, this quarter could have been better. The stock remained flat at $165 immediately following the results. Constellation Brands didn’t show it’s best hand this quarter, but does that create an opportunity to buy the stock right now? What happened in the latest quarter matters, but not as much as longer-term business quality and valuation, when deciding whether to invest in this stock.

Senate Tax Bill Strikes Clean Energy But Leaves Room for Relief,2025-07-02 05:29:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/solar-firms-surge-senate-drops-165808818.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The Senate version of President Donald Trump’s tax-and-spending bill would soften the blow for wind and solar developers, which had feared a sharp reduction in subsidies that helped spur a renewable power boom in the past few years. But the bill now faces conservatives in the House of Representatives eager to kill those credits. Most Read from Bloomberg Struggling Downtowns Are Looking to Lure New Crowds Sprawl Is Still Not the Answer California Exempts Building Projects From Environmental Law What Gothenburg Got Out of Congestion Pricing The measure that passed the Senate Tuesday removes a proposed tax on some projects and would allow renewable developers potentially five more years to qualify for federal incentives created under former President Joe Biden’s landmark climate law. But the bill would still hobble US clean energy development at a time when the demand for electricity is booming. And the House could still tighten restrictions on power developers. When that chamber passed its version of the bill in May, it included an aggressive phase-out of key wind and solar tax incentives. A key House Republican, Chip Roy of Texas, on Tuesday blasted the eased energy tax credit provisions as “a deal killer.” While the provisions in the Senate bill avoided a worst-case scenario, opponents also say the measures will lead to higher energy prices and a weaker economy. “It went from terrible to bad,” Jason Grumet, head of trade group American Clean Power, said of the Senate-passed legislation. “It’s hard to say I’m psyched about a bill that’s a step back on energy policy, but it’s considerably improved.” Under the Senate bill, solar developers could start construction through mid-2026 and have five years to build and receive the full production tax credits, according to a note from analysts at Roth Capital Partners. “This would be a big win as volumes likely would not drop off a cliff in 2028, as the prior Senate version draft proposed,” the note stated. Shares in Sunrun Inc. were up about 10%, Enphase Energy Inc. was up about 3% and SolarEdge Technologies Inc. closed up about 7% in New York. The Senate-passed measure spiked a previously proposed excise tax on wind and solar projects that use a certain threshold of components made in China. That represents a win for renewable power developers who’d warned the higher cost could prevent some projects from ever getting built. But the proposed excise tax targeting projects with Chinese-made equipment had support among solar manufacturers, including companies that have built new factories in the US on the promise of domestic-content purchase incentives embedded in the IRA. “It’s a stab in the back to the workers and companies that are building out the factories,” Mike Carr, executive director of the Solar Energy Manufacturers for America Coalition, said in an interview. Without the excise tax there’s no incentive for domestically made equipment, he said. The Senate-passed bill would “harm US manufacturers and invite China to flood our market again with dumped solar panels,” said Danny O’Brien, president of corporate affairs at manufacturer solar company Qcells. “Industry and government have spent more than a decade reshoring the solar manufacturing industry from China to the US.” The various iterations of Trump’s tax and spending package have whipsawed much of the renewable energy industry — and, with it, shares of developers, installers and manufacturers. The addition over the weekend of the proposed tax on some wind and solar projects stunned the industry, prompting shares to slide Monday. Clean energy trade groups had warned that without changes, Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill” would have threatened some wind farms and solar arrays already under construction. The changes weren’t enough to satisfy renewable developers who on Tuesday said the Senate-passed bill still poses a major threat to the industry. “Despite limited improvements, this legislation undermines the very foundation of America’s manufacturing comeback and global energy leadership. If this bill becomes law, families will face higher electric bills, factories will shut down, Americans will lose their jobs, and our electric grid will grow weaker,” Abigail Ross Hopper, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said in a statement. --With assistance from Erik Wasson and Janet Freund.

Lululemon's lawsuit against Costco highlights the rise of fashion 'dupes',2025-07-02 05:29:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lululemons-lawsuit-against-costco-highlights-202909845.html,"NEW YORK (AP) — Fashion “dupes,” or less expensive versions of high-end clothing and other accessories, are just about everywhere these days. They're also drawing some businesses into legal battles. In the latest example, Lululemon slapped a lawsuit against Costco on Friday, accusing the wholesale club operator of selling lower-priced duplicates of some of its popular athleisure apparel. Across the retail industry, it’s far from a new phenomenon. But social media is pushing the culture of online dupe shopping to new heights as influencers direct their followers to where they can buy the knockoffs. Want a taste of Hermès' $1,000 fuzzy slippers? Target has a version for $15. Looking for a $2,800 price Bottega Veneta hobo bag? There’s a version for $99 on online clothing and accessories upstart Quince, which has become a go-to for fashionistas. It's not even the first time Lululemon has encountered what it says are knockoffs of its clothing, which often carry steep price tags of over $100 each for leggings and sporty zip-ups. Without specifying additional sellers beyond Costco in Friday’s complaint, Lululemon noted that a handful companies have “replicated or copied” its apparel to sell cheaper offerings — including those popularized online through hashtags like “LululemonDupes” on TikTok and other social media platforms. Dupes aren't new For years, companies have rolled out a range of cheaper option for consumers to buy instead of pricey name-brands or designer labels — often through retailers' house or generic brands. Unlike more direct copies of the product with an unauthorized trademark or logo of a patented brand, “pure” dupes that just resemble certain features are generally legitimate. They can even spark awareness of the original items. But the rising frenzy for dupes, particularly in the fashion space, signals that many shoppers want a taste of luxury, but no longer want to pay for (or care about) getting the real thing. Late last year, for example, discount chain Walmart created a buzz when it started selling a leather bag online that resembled Hermès’ coveted Birkin bag. The $78 item — sold by Kamugo, which doesn’t appear to have its own website — was a fraction of the price of the original, which goes from $9,000 to hundreds of thousands of dollars on resale and auction sites. Influencers labeled the leather bag a “wirkin.” Other suppliers including BESTSPR, YMTQ and Judy were listed on Walmart’s site selling similar totes. While popular among shoppers, these kind of look-alikes can frustrate the targeted companies. Following the viral fame of the “wirkin,” Hermès Executive Chairman Axel Dumas shared his annoyance, for example. “Making a copy like this is quite detestable,” Dumas said in a corporate earnings call in February. Still, he acknowledged that it was “quite touching” to see so many consumers want a bag with the Birkin style — and that “difference in quality” was still evident, noting that nobody bought the dupe thinking it was from Hermès. When dupes venture into uncertain legal territory Alexandra Roberts, a professor of law and media at Northeastern University, said that “the term ‘dupe’ itself doesn’t tell us much about legality,"" noting the word has also been used to describe more traditional counterfeits. But overall, dupes can move into shaky legal territory, including copyright and trademark infringement, particularly if a dupe marketer makes false claims about the duplicate or the original. “With fashion, in particular, we’re going to get into some thorny questions,"" Roberts said. That includes what intellectual property rights exist and how enforceable they are, she explained, and whether there is actual infringement or if a product is just “positioning itself as a less expensive alternative.” Often such disputes boil down trademark questions around consumer confusion or patented product designs. Several businesses have already put this to the test, but not always successfully. In December, for example, Benefit lost a lawsuit in California over E.l.f.'s $6 Lash ’N Roll mascara, which is similar to Benefit’s $29 Roller Lash mascara. The judge’s decision was “a resounding win for us,” E.lf. CEO Tarang Amin previously told The Associated Press. “The basic reality is we always put our E.l.f. twist on it,” he said. “It’s an E.l.f. product that’s a much better value.” Lululemon sues Costco In its lawsuit, Lululemon argued that Costco had “unlawfully traded” on Lululemon’s reputation and that it was suing as part of wider intellectual property enforcement “directed to retailers who have chosen to copy rather than compete.” Lululemon accuses Costco of making duplicates of several products, including its popular Scuba hoodies, Define jackets and ABC pants. Lululemon says one of the duplicates that Costco sells is the Hi-Tec Men’s Scuba Full Zip, with the lawsuit showing a screenshot image of Costco’s website showing the item priced at $19.97. Roberts said she was “a little skeptical” of some of Lululemon's claims, noting that the design patents in particular could be hard to challenge. And she pointed to Lululemon's asserting common law trade dress over a “triangle kind of shape in the crotch region” of the ABC pants. “My first reaction as a trademark expert is that looks pretty functional,” she said, and functional matter is not protected under trademark law. “I was just cracking up because that particular claim seemed really far-fetched to me. Those pants look really basic."" Still, Roberts noted that Lululemon had some plausible claims. Lululemon alleges that Costco is known to use manufacturers of popular branded products for its private label Kirkland brand, although the companies involved don't clearly reveal that information to customers. Due to this, Lululemon claims some shoppers may believe that Kirkland-branded products are made by the authentic supplier of the “original” products. Roberts said this could rule in Lululemon's favor as something that “weighs toward consumer confusion.” Still, she noted that most of the products Lululemon mentioned in its complaint weren't sold under the Kirkland brand, which could undermine the argument. A message was left Tuesday seeking comment from Costco on the lawsuit. Lululemon found itself in a similar dispute with Peloton in 2021, when it sued the exercise bike company over alleged “copycat products” in its then-new clothing lines. Two years later, the companies announced a five-year partnership that included Lululemon becoming the primary athletic apparel partner to Peloton. —- AP Business Writer Michelle Chapman contributed to this report."
X is piloting a program that lets AI chatbots generate Community Notes,2025-07-02 05:26:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/x-piloting-program-lets-ai-202612330.html,"Image Credits:Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch The social platform X will pilot a feature that allows AI chatbots to generate Community Notes. Community Notes is a Twitter-era feature that Elon Musk has expanded under his ownership of the service, now called X. Users who are part of this fact-checking program can contribute comments that add context to certain posts, which are then checked by other users before they appear attached to a post. A Community Note may appear, for example, on a post of an AI-generated video that is not clear about its synthetic origins, or as an addendum to a misleading post from a politician. Notes become public when they achieve consensus between groups that have historically disagreed on past ratings. Community Notes have been successful enough on X to inspire Meta , TikTok , and YouTube to pursue similar initiatives — Meta eliminated its third-party fact-checking programs altogether in exchange for this low-cost, community-sourced labor. But it remains to be seen if the use of AI chatbots as fact-checkers will prove helpful or harmful. These AI notes can be generated using X’s Grok or by using other AI tools and connecting them to X via an API. Any note that an AI submits will be treated the same as a note submitted by a person, which means that it will go through the same vetting process to encourage accuracy. The use of AI in fact-checking seems dubious, given how common it is for AIs to hallucinate , or make up context that is not based in reality. Image Credits: Research by X Community Notes (opens in a new window) According to a paper published this week by researchers working on X Community Notes, it is recommended that humans and LLMs work in tandem. Human feedback can enhance AI note generation through reinforcement learning, with human note raters remaining as a final check before notes are published. “The goal is not to create an AI assistant that tells users what to think, but to build an ecosystem that empowers humans to think more critically and understand the world better,” the paper says. “LLMs and humans can work together in a virtuous loop.” Even with human checks, there is still a risk to relying too heavily on AI, especially since users will be able to embed LLMs from third parties. OpenAI’s ChatGPT, for example, recently experienced issues with a model being overly sycophantic . If an LLM prioritizes “helpfulness” over accurately completing a fact-check, then the AI-generated comments may end up being flat out inaccurate. There’s also concern that human raters will be overloaded by the amount of AI-generated comments, lowering their motivation to adequately complete this volunteer work. Users shouldn’t expect to see AI-generated Community Notes yet — X plans to test these AI contributions for a few weeks before rolling them out more broadly if they’re successful."

The company’s full-year revenue guidance of $3.25 billion at the midpoint came in 1.1% above analysts’ estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $1.86 per share was 88.8% above analysts’ consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy Greenbrier? Find out in our full research report . Greenbrier (GBX) Q2 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $842.7 million vs analyst estimates of $785.7 million (2.7% year-on-year growth, 7.3% beat) Adjusted EPS: $1.86 vs analyst estimates of $0.99 (88.8% beat) Adjusted EBITDA: $128.5 million vs analyst estimates of $98.34 million (15.2% margin, 30.7% beat) The company reconfirmed its revenue guidance for the full year of $3.25 billion at the midpoint Operating Margin: 11%, up from 8.8% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow was $56.5 million, up from -$50.2 million in the same quarter last year Sales Volumes (orders received) fell 38.1% year on year (37% in the same quarter last year) Market Capitalization: $1.45 billion Company Overview Having designed the industry’s first double-decker railcar in the 1980s, Greenbrier (NYSE:GBX) supplies the freight rail transportation industry with railcars and related services. Revenue Growth A company’s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one grows for years. Unfortunately, Greenbrier’s 2.9% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was sluggish. This fell short of our benchmarks and is a poor baseline for our analysis. Greenbrier Quarterly Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within industrials, a half-decade historical view may miss cycles, industry trends, or a company capitalizing on catalysts such as a new contract win or a successful product line. Greenbrier’s performance shows it grew in the past but relinquished its gains over the last two years, as its revenue fell by 4.5% annually. Greenbrier isn’t alone in its struggles as the Heavy Transportation Equipment industry experienced a cyclical downturn, with many similar businesses observing lower sales at this time. Greenbrier Year-On-Year Revenue Growth We can dig further into the company’s revenue dynamics by analyzing its number of units sold, which reached 3,900 in the latest quarter. Over the last two years, Greenbrier’s units sold averaged 12% year-on-year growth. Because this number is better than its revenue growth, we can see the company’s average selling price decreased. Greenbrier Units Sold This quarter, Greenbrier reported modest year-on-year revenue growth of 2.7% but beat Wall Street’s estimates by 7.3%. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to decline by 9.3% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years.

Operating Margin Greenbrier was profitable over the last five years but held back by its large cost base. Its average operating margin of 6.3% was weak for an industrials business. This result isn’t too surprising given its low gross margin as a starting point. On the plus side, Greenbrier’s operating margin rose by 10.6 percentage points over the last five years, as its sales growth gave it operating leverage. Greenbrier Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP) This quarter, Greenbrier generated an operating margin profit margin of 11%, up 2.2 percentage points year on year. Since its gross margin expanded more than its operating margin, we can infer that leverage on its cost of sales was the primary driver behind the recently higher efficiency. Earnings Per Share We track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable. Greenbrier’s EPS grew at an astounding 18.2% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years, higher than its 2.9% annualized revenue growth. This tells us the company became more profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded. Greenbrier Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP) Diving into Greenbrier’s quality of earnings can give us a better understanding of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, Greenbrier’s operating margin expanded by 10.6 percentage points over the last five years. On top of that, its share count shrank by 3.9%. These are positive signs for shareholders because improving profitability and share buybacks turbocharge EPS growth relative to revenue growth. Greenbrier Diluted Shares Outstanding Like with revenue, we analyze EPS over a shorter period to see if we are missing a change in the business. For Greenbrier, its two-year annual EPS growth of 64.4% was higher than its five-year trend. We love it when earnings growth accelerates, especially when it accelerates off an already high base. In Q2, Greenbrier reported EPS at $1.86, up from $1.06 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts’ estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. We also like to analyze expected EPS growth based on Wall Street analysts’ consensus projections, but there is insufficient data. Key Takeaways from Greenbrier’s Q2 Results We were impressed by how significantly Greenbrier blew past analysts’ sales volume expectations this quarter. We were also excited its EPS outperformed Wall Street’s estimates by a wide margin. Zooming out, we think this quarter featured some important positives. The stock traded up 11.2% to $52.31 immediately after reporting. Sure, Greenbrier had a solid quarter, but if we look at the bigger picture, is this stock a buy? The latest quarter does matter, but not nearly as much as longer-term fundamentals and valuation, when deciding if the stock is a buy. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it’s free ."

Trump Sticks With July 9 Tariff Deadline While Criticizing Japan,2025-07-02 05:18:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-dismisses-extension-july-9-191842164.html,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump said he is not considering delaying his July 9 deadline for higher tariffs to resume and renewed his threat to cut off talks and impose duty rates on several nations, including Japan. Most Read from Bloomberg Struggling Downtowns Are Looking to Lure New Crowds Sprawl Is Still Not the Answer California Exempts Building Projects From Environmental Law What Gothenburg Got Out of Congestion Pricing “No, I’m not thinking about the pause,” Trump said Tuesday when asked whether he would extend the negotiating period with trading partners. “I’ll be writing letters to a lot of countries.” US stocks pulled back after Trump’s comments to reporters aboard Air Force One. The S&P 500 Index quickly dropped 14 points on the headlines after trading was steady earlier in the day. The benchmark was down 0.1% as of 3:36 p.m. in New York. The Cboe VIX Index jumped above 16.8 before paring its advance. A Bloomberg gauge of the dollar changed little after Trump’s remarks, while the yen held onto gains versus the US currency, outperforming all of its Group-of-10 peers. Investors are closely watching how the president decides to handle the current pause on his April tariffs, which he put on hold for 90 days to allow time for talks. Trump for weeks has sought to exert leverage over trading partners with threats to set high levies on governments he sees as being difficult. His top economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, a day earlier signaled agreements would be announced after the July 4 holiday and the signing of the tax and spending bill the US Senate approved. Since the president put his country-by-country tariffs on hold, he and his team have repeatedly promised a flood of agreements that would rebalance trading relationships that he has long decried as unfair. But the only two such pacts thus far have been broad frameworks with the UK and China, which left several key issues unresolved and many specifics to be negotiated later. The president on Tuesday deepened his criticism of Tokyo for not accepting US rice exports. He also said that auto trade between the two nations is imbalanced. Japan should be forced to “pay 30%, 35% or whatever the number is that we determine, because we also have a very big trade deficit with Japan,” Trump said. Trump proposed a 24% tariff on Japanese goods in April. Those have been subject to a 10% charge during the negotiating period. “I’m not sure we’re going to make a deal. I doubt it with Japan, they’re very tough. You have to understand, they’re very spoiled,” Trump said. Earlier: India’s Foreign Minister Sees US Trade Deal as Possible in Days The president sounded more optimistic about reaching a deal with India. When asked about the prospects for an agreement over the next week, Trump said: “possibly. That’s going to be a different kind of a deal.” “It’s going to be a deal where we’re able to go in and compete. Right now, India doesn’t accept anybody in,” he said. “I think India is going to do that, and if they do that, we’re going to have a deal for much less tariffs.” India’s foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said this week his country is close to finalizing an agreement with the US, as they work through thorny issues including coming industry-specific tariffs and market access for genetically modified crops from America. Talks have intensified, with India’s chief negotiator Rajesh Agarwal extending his stay in the US to iron out disagreements. Other negotiations have proved even more difficult — and Trump has been keen this week to make an example out of Japan. That could be seen as a warning to other countries to get in line or face prohibitive tariffs. Yet the president also showed his penchant for quick reversals last week with Canada, initially cutting off talks but then restarting them days later after Ottawa scrapped a digital-services tax. Japan’s efforts under Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to maintain a steady, friendly approach to negotiations have been put to the test by Trump’s efforts to ramp up pressure for deals. Tokyo has pushed for relief for its crucial auto sector, as well as other tariff exceptions, but the deliberate approach risks backfiring as Trump looks for quick wins on trade. “I love Japan. I really like the new prime minister,” Trump told reporters. “But they and others are so spoiled from having ripped us off for 30, 40, years that it’s really hard for them to make a deal.” --With assistance from Prateek Mazumdar, Yoshiaki Nohara, Sakura Murakami, Alastair Gale, Elena Popina and Carter Johnson.

Treasury Yields Drop to Lowest Level in Two Months Before Powell Speaks,2025-07-02 05:15:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/treasury-yields-drop-lowest-level-095754338.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Treasuries fell on Tuesday after a report on US job openings failed to provide justification for a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut as soon as next month. Most Read from Bloomberg Struggling Downtowns Are Looking to Lure New Crowds Sprawl Is Still Not the Answer California Exempts Building Projects From Environmental Law Bonds slipped across maturities with yields trading close to session highs late in New York. Shorter-dated tenors, those more sensitive to Fed policy shifts, rose the most. The two-year note’s yield was up about six basis points to 3.78% — rebounding from below 3.70% earlier in the session — following JOLTS data that showed a steep increase in openings, a sign of strength in the labor market. The market had been rallying in anticipation that three reports on the employment picture would spur Fed rate cuts. Traders saw a remote chance of the first of those coming in July if the reports showed weakness in the labor market. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, speaking at a global monetary policy event in Sintra, Portugal, declined to rule out a July cut. “It seems as if the market has bypassed the data-dependency” of Powell “and focused more on the much stronger May JOLTs data,” said John Brady, managing director at RJ O’Brien. Momentum has been building in favor of earlier Fed rate cuts despite expectations that tariffs introduced by the US administration this year will contribute to faster inflation. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he’s not considering delaying the July 9 deadline for those levies. A July rate cut is viewed as a long shot, but swap contracts linked to Fed policy shifts assign it about 15% odds versus near zero last month, and in the past week, interest-rate options trades looking for lower yields and a faster pace of Fed easing have been popular. A quarter-point cut is fully priced in for September. Economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on Monday predicted Fed rate cuts in September, October and December. They previously expected one, in December. Related story: Goldman Sachs Pulls Forward Fed Rate-Cut Forecast to September Against the backdrop of record highs for US stocks and other favorable financial conditions, Fed policymakers may insist on evidence of a faltering job market before cutting rates. Two other reports this week — the ADP report on private-sector job creation and the US Labor Department’s employment report, both for June — could still provide it. “If the jobs data finally confirm the concerns on the labor front, it gets the Fed off the fence, to at least start to signal that July is a possibility,” said George Goncalves, head of US macro strategy at MUFG Securities Americas Inc. “You’ll get more Fed speakers leaning toward a cut in July. Investors don’t want to miss that pivot. But it’s all predicated on a weak NFP,” he said, referring to the employment report’s nonfarm payrolls component. The Treasury market delivered its best performance since February last month as softer-than-expected inflation data and growth in jobless claims drove expectations for an earlier start to Fed rate cuts. Traders are pricing in around 65 basis points of cuts by year-end, compared with around 50 basis points at the end of May. Speaking in Sintra, Powell — who has said that widespread expectations for tariff-induced inflation to emerge later this year mean that the Fed should be cautious — reiterated that message in part. He said Fed officials would “expect to see over the summer some higher [inflation] readings, but we’re prepared to learn that it can be higher or lower or later or sooner than we’d expected.” Policy will evolve “meeting by meeting,” he said, “but I wouldn’t take any meeting off the table or put it directly on the table. It’s going to depend on how the how the data evolve.” Powell’s comments came as the US administration steps up its criticism of the Fed as being too slow to reduce borrowing costs. Trump sent a note to Powell on Monday with a list of interest rates in other countries, calling for cuts in the US, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg TV that policymakers “seem a little frozen at the wheel” with regard to deciding on rates right now. “Powell has been fairly balanced, but I think he just announced what is coming down the road, and that is a rate cut and possibly more than expected,” Tom di Galoma, managing director at Mischler Financial Group, said. Trump’s announced intention to replace Powell when his term ends in May 2026 with a Fed chair who’ll cut rates has helped drive short-term Treasury yields lower. Also in focus is the latest US budget deal that may alter expectations for deficits and borrowing. On Tuesday, the US Senate passed a $3.3 trillion tax and spending cut bill and the package, which now goes to the House, combines $4.5 trillion in tax cuts with $1.2 trillion in spending cuts.

Tesla stock sinks 5% after Trump hits at Musk for getting 'more subsidy than any human being in history',2025-07-02 05:11:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-sinks-6-trump-211749660.html,"Donald Trump and Elon Musk Roberto Schmidt / AFP via Getty Images Tesla stock sunk 5% on Tuesday after President Donald Trump fired a new shot at Elon Musk. Trump said Musk had government subsidies than ""any human being in history"" in a post on Truth Social. The pair's feud was reignited by more criticism from Musk over Trump's tax bill. President Donald Trump and Elon Musk are still feuding , much to the chagrin of Tesla investors. Tesla stock dropped 5% on Tuesday as traders digested a new Truth Social post from Trump, which highlighted how much assistance Musk has gotten from the US government. The president also suggested having DOGE look into cancelling contracts with Musk's business empire . ""Elon may get most subsidy than any human being in history, by fair, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa,"" Trump wrote , referring to Musk's birth nation. The post also coincided with recent selling pressure after Tesla sales saw a 45% year-over-year decline in the EU . A Washington Post analysis in February found that Musk's companies had received at least $38 billion in federal contracts, subsidies, tax credits, and loans spanning the last two decades. In his post, Trump added that he had always been ""strongly against"" the electric vehicle mandate , which he said Musk knew about before the Tesla CEO endorsed him during his presidential campaign. ""No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE. Perhaps we should have DOGE take a good, hard, look at this? BIG MONEY TO BE SAVED!!!"" the president continued. Trump's post came shortly after Musk ramped up his criticisms of Trump's "" Big Beautiful Bill "" on X. In a post on Saturday, Musk called the tax bill "" utterly insane and destructive, "" and said the bill could kill millions of jobs. The comments come several weeks after Musk and Trump first began sparring on social media about the GOP tax and spending bill, which sparked a steep sell-off in Tesla before the two billionaires appeared to come to a truce. Tesla stock has had a volatile ride so far in 2025. The stock plunged over the first four months of the year amid declining EV sales and turmoil stemming from Trump's tariffs. But shares have rallied of lows in recent months on positive trade developments and Musk announcing he would step back from DOGE in May , though the stock is still down 21% year-to-date.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau dismisses $95M overdraft case vs. Navy Federal Credit Union,2025-07-02 05:11:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-dismisses-201127614.html,"NEW YORK (AP) — Navy Federal Credit Union will no longer have to refund $80 million to servicemen and women for illegally charging them overdraft fees on their accounts, after the President Donald Trump-led Consumer Financial Protection Bureau moved to dismiss the case. It's the latest example of how the Trump-led CFPB is undoing much of the work it did under President Biden, even in instances where the bad actors agreed to provide redress and compensation to victims. The case dates from late 2024 and deals with an issue known as “authorized positive overdraft fees,"" which happen when a bank initially approves a debit card transaction but later charges the customer a overdraft fee when that earlier transaction settles, typically a couple of days later, and there's insufficient funds in the customer's bank account. Navy Federal was found to authorize these types of overdraft fees between 2017 and 2022, later stopping the practice and refunding some customers who were impacted. Under its previous settlement, Navy Federal would have needed to pay a $15 million fine to the CFPB and refund $80 million in illegally paid overdraft fees. At the time, Navy Federal said it “fully cooperated with the CFPB’s investigation and we will continue to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, just as we always have and as we believe we did here.” The CFPB gave little reason for withdrawing the consent order. Under Russell Vought, the president's budget director who is also the acting head of the bureau, the bureau has withdrawn roughly half a dozen consent orders and ended other settlements the bureau previously reached with financial services companies. The withdrawn order says that Navy Federal consented to have the order withdrawn. In a statement, Navy Federal defended its use of overdraft and supported the CFPB's decision. “Navy Federal’s commitment to prioritize and protect our members is core to who we are. Our overdraft program allows our members to make necessary, everyday purchases without going into long-term debt or turning to payday lenders. Navy Federal complied with all applicable laws and regulations at the time and continues to do so. We firmly believe the CFPB’s decision to terminate the order was appropriate."" Navy Federal is, by far, the largest credit union in the country with roughly 14 million members and $180 billion in assets. If Navy Federal were considered a traditional bank, it would be the 24th largest bank in the country by assets. While Vought has dramatically narrowed the CFPB's mission and scope, the bureau has previously said that financial issues for servicemen and women remain a priority for the bureau . The CFPB did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"Bank Stocks Near Record With Buyback, Dividend Boosts on Horizon",2025-07-02 05:07:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-stocks-near-record-buyback-200747382.html,"(Bloomberg) -- US bank stocks closed at their highest level in three years as investors continued to pile into the group amid speculation they will begin to boost buybacks and dividends after the lenders comfortably cleared the Federal Reserve’s stress test last week. Most Read from Bloomberg Struggling Downtowns Are Looking to Lure New Crowds Sprawl Is Still Not the Answer California Exempts Building Projects From Environmental Law The KBW Bank Index rose 1.5% Tuesday, closing at the highest level since February 2022 and under 4% from its early 2022 all-time high. The gauge posted a ninth consecutive day of gains, matching its longest winning streak on record. All but two of the gauge’s 24 members were higher, led by Western Alliance Bancorp, East West Bancorp Inc. and Zions Bancorp NA. Tuesday’s rally coincided with a breather for the broader market — which had closed at consecutive records — as investors rotated out of technology shares and into relatively safer pockets of the market. A basket of value stocks outperformed a basket of momentum stocks by nearly 2 percentage points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Banks headed into the week on strong footing after all lenders subjected to the Fed’s annual stress tests passed comfortably, setting the stage for the group to boost buybacks and dividends for shareholders. The results showed “much better than expected declines in stress capital buffers at all our banks,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts including Vivek Juneja wrote in a note. “Expect the large decrease in capital requirements to likely drive increased share buybacks at all the banks that saw a decrease.” Meanwhile, analysts at Raymond James anticipate total payouts to “modestly increase,” adding that they “view the stress test results to be a net positive and should garner increasing investor interest in the sector.” With quarterly earnings ahead, the easing of bank capital rules upcoming, loosening regulations and elevated interest rates at play US banking stocks are primed to keep ripping higher. Hedge funds are also see further room to run, snapping up shares at a furious pace. It’s the rebound that many investors had been waiting for following President Donald Trump’s November reelection, which many expected to usher in a wave of banking deregulation and pro-business policies. That was before he unleashed a global trade war in April that briefly knocked the industry off course. The “results of this year’s stress test is more evidence that this period is the most positive regulatory change for banks in 3 decades,” Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo wrote in a note. Goldman Sachs was the big test winner, along with JPMorgan, Bank of America and M&T Bank Corp, he said. (Updates with closing shares.)

Dow soars almost 400 points as investors rotate out of tech and eye Europe,2025-07-02 05:06:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dow-soars-almost-400-points-200644025.html,"Markets saw a movement away from the tech sector , which had previously dominated the recovery of U.S. equities. In foreign exchange markets the U.S. dollar maintained its current downward trajectory, while the euro strengthened. Both factors have been driving investors toward European stocks. The Dow Jones rose 396 points, for a 1% gain, on Tuesday, as investors mostly rotated out of the tech sector. That shift favored the 30-company Dow Jones, which is a 1% off its all-time high reached in December 2024. Meanwhile the S&P 500 fell 0.11% and the Nasdaq dropped 0.83%. Several of the tech giants saw their share prices fall. Nvidia closed down 3%; Microsoft declined 1.1%; and Meta ended the day 2.6% below where it opened. Tesla had the steepest drop, closing at $302 a share, 5.3% lower than at the start of the session, though some of that fall may be attributed to chief executive Elon Musk’s renewed feud with President Donald Trump. Across the pond, European markets came into focus on Tuesday after reports of investors shifting money into the continent intensified. However, stocks in the European Union tumbled on the day. The Stoxx 600 dropped 0.2% after a turbulent few days in which the index had multiple peaks and valleys. The German DAX spent the entire session in a negative slide, closing down 1%. The French CAC closed slightly lower, down four basis points for the day. There was a regional bright spot in the United Kingdom where the FTSE 100 rose 0.3% In currency markets the U.S. dollar index (DXY) was essentially flat on the day, after surging in the morning. On Tuesday the DXY was down 0.1%, hovering around $96.76. That comes after the U.S. dollar had its worst performance in the first half of a calendar year since 1973. Since the start of the year the U.S. dollar declined 11% against a basket of similar currencies. The ongoing weakness in the dollar reflects the sense of uncertainty that has pervaded the economy in the last few months. But the dollar’s slide has been the euro’s rally. The euro is up just under 14% so far year-to-date against the dollar. On Tuesday, the euro spiked in the morning hours, going as high as $1.1832, before falling back down to $1.1765 in the mid-afternoon. European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde called the exchange rate “a reflection of the strength of our economy” during the ECB Forum in Sintra, Portugal on Tuesday. “There has been a clear appreciation relative to the dollar,” she said on a panel with other central bankers, including Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell. “Depending on how you look at it, it’s either depreciation of the dollar or appreciation of the euro, and there might be a bit of both.” As the euro and the dollar move in opposite directions, investors have started rebalancing their portfolios toward European equities. The combination of greater stability in Europe, appreciation of the euro, and increased levels of defense spending have combined to make the European Union a more appealing destination for investors than it had been in recent years. “In that particular case, we’re also looking at the movement, the flow of capitals and the attractiveness of euro-denominated assets, which is also an interesting phenomena that we’ve observed lately,” Lagarde said.

What's in the latest version of Trump's big bill that passed the Senate,2025-07-02 05:05:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-latest-version-trumps-big-200534763.html,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Republicans are getting closer to the finish line in getting their tax and spending cut bill through Congress with a final House vote possible on Wednesday. At some 887 pages, the legislation is a sprawling collection of tax breaks , spending cuts and other Republican priorities, including new money for national defense and deportations . President Donald Trump has admonished Republicans, who hold majority power in the House and Senate, to skip their holiday vacations and deliver the bill by the Fourth of July. Democrats are united against the legislation, but are powerless to stop the bill if Republicans are united. The Senate passed the bill, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote. The House passed an earlier iteration of the bill in May with just one vote to spare. Now, it will take up the Senate-amended measure. Here's the latest on what's in the bill. There could be changes as GOP lawmakers continue to negotiate. Tax cuts are the priority Republicans say the bill is crucial because there would be a massive tax increase after December when tax breaks from Trump's first term expire. The legislation contains about $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. The existing tax rates and brackets would become permanent under the bill. It temporarily would add new tax breaks that Trump campaigned on: no taxes on tips, overtime pay, the ability to deduct interest payments for some automotive loans, along with a $6,000 deduction for older adults who earn no more than $75,000 a year. It would boost the $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200. Millions of families at lower income levels would not get the full credit. A cap on state and local deductions, called SALT, would quadruple to $40,000 for five years. It's a provision important to New York and other high tax states, though the House wanted it to last for 10 years. There are scores of business-related tax cuts, including allowing businesses to immediately write off 100% of the cost of equipment and research. The wealthiest households would see a $12,000 increase from the legislation, which would cost the poorest people $1,600 a year, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analysis of the House's version. Middle-income taxpayers would see a tax break of $500 to $1,500, the CBO said . Money for deportations, a border wall and the Golden Dome The bill would provide some $350 billion for Trump's border and national security agenda, including $46 billion for the U.S.-Mexico border wall and $45 billion for 100,000 migrant detention facility beds, as he aims to fulfill his promise of the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history. Money would go for hiring 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, with $10,000 signing bonuses and a surge of Border Patrol officers, as well. The goal is to deport some 1 million people per year. The homeland security secretary would have a new $10 billion fund for grants for states that help with federal immigration enforcement and deportation actions. To help pay for it, immigrants would face various new fees, including when seeking asylum protections. For the Pentagon, the bill would provide billions for ship building, munitions systems, and quality of life measures for servicemen and women, as well as $25 billion for the development of the Golden Dome missile defense system. The Defense Department would have $1 billion for border security. How to pay for it? Cuts to Medicaid and other programs To help partly offset the lost tax revenue and new spending, Republicans aim to cut back on Medicaid and food assistance for the poor. Republicans argue they are trying to rightsize the safety net programs for the population they were initially designed to serve, mainly pregnant women, the disabled and children, and root out what they describe as waste, fraud and abuse. The package includes new 80-hour-a-month work requirements for many adults receiving Medicaid and food stamps, including older people up to age 65. Parents of children 14 and older would have to meet the program’s work requirements. There's also a proposed new $35 co-payment that can be charged to patients using Medicaid services. More than 71 million people rely on Medicaid, which expanded under Obama's Affordable Care Act, and 40 million use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program . Most already work, according to analysts. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 11.8 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 if the bill became law and 3 million more would not qualify for food stamps, also known as SNAP benefits. Republicans are looking to have states pick up some of the cost for SNAP benefits. Currently, the federal government funds all benefit costs. Under the bill, states beginning in 2028 will be required to contribute a set percentage of those costs if their payment error rate exceeds 6%. Payment errors include both underpayments and overpayments. But the Senate bill temporarily delays the start date of that cost-sharing for states with the highest SNAP error rates. Alaska has the highest error rate in the nation at nearly 25%, according to Department of Agriculture data . Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, had fought for the exception. She was a decisive vote in getting the bill through the Senate. A ‘death sentence’ for clean energy? Republicans are proposing to dramatically roll back tax breaks designed to boost clean energy projects fueled by renewable sources such as energy and wind. The tax breaks were a central component of President Joe Biden's 2022 landmark bill focused on addressing climate change and lowering healthcare costs. Democratic Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden went so far as to call the GOP provisions a “death sentence for America’s wind and solar industries and an inevitable hike in utility bills.” A tax break for people who buy new or used electric vehicles would expire on Sept. 30 of this year, instead of at the end of 2032 under current law. Meanwhile, a tax credit for the production of critical materials will be expanded to include metallurgical coal used in steelmaking. Trump savings accounts and so, so much more A number of extra provisions reflect other GOP priorities. The House and Senate both have a new children's savings program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury. The Senate provided $40 million to establish Trump’s long-sought “National Garden of American Heroes.” There's a new excise tax on university endowments. A $200 tax on gun silencers and short-barreled rifles and shotguns was eliminated. One provision bars money to family planning providers, namely Planned Parenthood, while $88 million is earmarked for a pandemic response accountability committee. Another section expands the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, a hard-fought provision from GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for those impacted by nuclear development and testing. Billions would go for the Artemis moon mission and for the exploration of Mars. Additionally, a provision would increase the nation's debt limit, by $5 trillion, to allow continued borrowing to pay already accrued bills. Last-minute changes The Senate overwhelmingly revolted against a proposal meant to deter states from regulating artificial intelligence. Republican governors across the country asked for the moratorium to be removed and the Senate voted to do so with a resounding 99-1 vote. A provision was thrown in at the final hours that will provide $10 billion annually to rural hospitals for five years, or $50 billion in total. The Senate bill had originally provided $25 billion for the program, but that number was upped to win over holdout GOP senators and a coalition of House Republicans warning that reduced Medicaid provider taxes would hurt rural hospitals. The amended bill also stripped out a new tax on wind and solar projects that use a certain percentage of components from China. What's the final cost? Altogether, the Congressional Budget Office projects that the bill would increase federal deficits over the next 10 years by nearly $3.3 trillion from 2025 to 2034. Or not, depending on how one does the math . Senate Republicans are proposing a unique strategy of not counting the existing tax breaks as a new cost because those breaks are already “current policy.” Republican senators say the Senate Budget Committee chairman has the authority to set the baseline for the preferred approach. Under the alternative Senate GOP view, the bill would reduce deficits by almost half a trillion dollars over the coming decade, the CBO said. Democrats say this is “magic math” that obscures the true costs of the tax breaks. Some nonpartisan groups worried about the country's fiscal trajectory are siding with Democrats in that regard. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says Senate Republicans are employing an “accounting gimmick that would make Enron executives blush.” ___"

The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) closed down 0.1%, pulling back from a record close after finishing above 6,200 for the first time on Monday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) fell around 0.7%, with Tesla ( TSLA ) stock sliding 5% as CEO Elon Musk's feud with Trump flared up again. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) rose about 1%, largely led by a pop in healthcare stocks including United Healthcare ( UNH ), which rose 4.5%. Senate lawmakers voted 50-50, with Vice President JD Vance breaking the tie, to pass Trump's signature tax and spending bill, racing to meet the president's desired July 4 deadline. The bill now goes back to the House, which will vote on the Senate's changes. Republicans wrangled over the bill's measures overnight, including one amendment that passed with strong bipartisan support: A strike-down of the ban on state-level AI regulation. They also ended up slightly softening a phase out of clean-energy tax credits. Another looming deadline has prompted the US to scale back Trump's push for full-blown ""reciprocal"" deals with trading partners, the Financial Times reported . Instead, officials are racing to find narrower agreements before July 9 , when the president's sweeping ""reciprocal"" tariffs are set to resume.

Jerome Powell spoke about the Fed's policy stance at an ECB forum in Portgual on Tuesday, fresh from another Trump attack pushing the Federal Reserve chair to slash interest rates to 1% — a huge 250-point reduction. Powell remarked that tariffs are causing the central bank to take its time before cutting interest rates, but he said the US economy remains healthy overall.

UnitedHealthcare ( UNH ) stock, which had been the worst performer in the Dow this year and down more than 35% to start 2025, rose about 4.5% on Tuesday. Tuesday's market action proved to be positive for a slew of laggards through the first half of this year. The small-cap Russell 2000 Index ( ^RUT ), which had underperformed all three major averages through the first six months of this year, rose more than 1% on Tuesday. Below is a look at how every Dow component performed on Tuesday. Tue, July 1, 2025 at 7:48 PM UTC Allie Canal Why Wall Street strategists are cautious about stock market's recent records Stocks staged a historic comeback from their April lows, finishing the first half of the year on a high note with the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) and Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) securing back-to-back all-time records. A large part of the market's gains has hinged on easing geopolitical tensions and tariff-related deescalations, including the emergence of the so-called TACO trade, an acronym for ""Trump Always Chickens Out."" The phrase captures a belief among some investors that the president often talks tough on tariffs but rarely follows through. That assumption has helped fuel a tailwind for markets in recent months as traders increasingly bet on last-minute policy pivots. Trade deal frameworks with China and the UK are reportedly now on the table ahead of Trump's self-imposed July 9 deadline. This has led investors to price in a ""Goldilocks scenario"" for stocks, with sustained earnings growth, little effects from tariffs, and rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. But Wall Street pros are signaling caution as they assess the path forward, which still includes many unknowns. ""Just as Goldilocks awoke from her sleep to confront three bears, there are several areas where this optimism is likely to be challenged,"" JPMorgan's economics and policy team, led by Bruce Kasman, wrote in a recent client note. Kasman cautioned investors not to ""get carried away by inflation momentum,"" warning that tariffs are still set to rise despite ongoing trade negotiations . This will add pressure to a US economy already grappling with softer consumer demand and signs of stalling global factory activity. ""The economy is entering the second half of the year on wobbly footing,"" Comerica Bank chief economist Bill Adams added. Read more here.

After several signs of slowing in the labor market have emerged over the past months in areas like continuing unemployment claims and slowing hiring, Tuesday's data reminds us that there's a bit of something for everyone in the current economic data being analyzed as investors debate when the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next. Tuesday's data suggested the labor market remained ""healthy"" in May, Capital Economics North America economist Alexandra Brown wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten wrote in a note that there was ""nothing"" in the May JOLTS report to shake the Fed's patient approach. But Vanden Houten noted that when the Fed does cut the ""risk is growing"" that the Fed's next interest rate cut is a 50 basis point move rather than 25 basis points.

Shares of Sunrun ( RUN ) surged roughly 10% in afternoon trading. Enphase Energy ( ENPH ), one of the worst-performing stocks this year, climbed about 4%, while SolarEdge Technologies ( SEDG ) gained approximately 7% shortly after the news broke. Senate leaders pushed the bill closer to passage in a highly anticipated vote on Tuesday. As Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reported , the measure passed with a 50-50 split in the Senate, with three Republican defections. Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote in favor of the bill, which marked a significant win for the solar and wind energy sectors. Here's why: The bill originally included a new tax on wind and solar projects using a certain amount of parts made in China. Some US manufacturers supported this to reduce dependence on China. But renewable energy developers warned it would raise costs for their projects because many still rely on Chinese parts. To note, the bill still plans to gradually end subsidies for new wind and solar projects starting after 2027, despite some Republican efforts to delay that cutoff.

The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) also showed that 5.5 million hires were made during the month, down from the 5.61 million made during April. The hiring rate ticked lower to 3.4% from 3.5%. In one sign that workers remain cautious about labor market conditions, the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, moved up to 2.1% from 2% in April.

When asked if the Fed would have cut interest rates by more by now if it weren't for higher tariffs, Powell stated, ""I think that’s right."" ""In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs,"" Powell continued. ""Essentially, all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs."" Powell noted that the US economy remains healthy overall but that he expects to see the effects of tariffs filter through the economic data in the coming months. In recent days, Powell has faced increased pressure, including in the form of handwritten notes, from President Trump to lower interest rates.

Coal Ash Holds Unexpected Wealth in Rare Earth Elements,2025-07-02 05:00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coal-ash-holds-unexpected-wealth-200000513.html,"Millions of tons of coal ash are currently sitting in ponds and landfills across the United States. The U.S. alone produces around 110 million tons of this coal mining byproduct each and every year. The ponds that house this ash pose a major threat to the environments that host them, but they might also hold the secret to homeshoring vital supply chains for critical minerals. Last year, scientists at the University of Texas (UT) at Austin analyzed coal ash samples collected from power plants across the United States and found that domestic coal ash reserves could contain up to 11 million tons of rare earth elements. These elements are central to a number of technological and infrastructural supply chains from batteries and solar panels to high-performance magnets. The significant presence of these materials in coal ash is therefore a major discovery that could shake up global supply chains for these increasingly in-demand materials. If the UT Austin calculations are accurate, those 11 million tons would represent nearly eight times the amount of rare earths that the United States currently has in reserve, and could be worth a whopping $8.4 billion. “This really exemplifies the ‘trash to treasure’ mantra,” said Bridget Scanlon, co-lead author of the UT Austin study and a research professor at the university’s Bureau of Economic Geology. “We’re basically trying to close the cycle and use waste and recover resources in the waste, while at the same time reducing environmental impacts.” Perhaps even more importantly, this domestic cache of critical minerals could help the United States break free of its reliance on Chinese supply chains . China provides about 38 percent of the world’s raw rare earth minerals, and accounts for 85-90 percent of the world’s rare earth mine-to-metal refining. What is more, Chinese refineries supply 68 percent of the world’s cobalt, 65 percent of nickel, and 60 percent of EV-battery-grade lithium. As a result, 75 percent of all EV batteries are made in China. All this means that disentangling from Chinese supply chains will be difficult, if not impossible, making tariffs painfully pyrrhic for United States manufacturers. According to the United States Geological Survey, the United States imported nearly 100 percent of the rare earth elements it consumed in 2018, with 80 percent sourced from China. Furthermore, Department of Energy data shows over 50 percent import reliance for the rest of its designated “ critical minerals ,” and complete reliance for 14 of them. And China is already clamping down on some rare earth supply chains in response to Trump’s continued trade war. All of this serves to make coal ash a potential godsend for U.S. energy sovereignty and security in an era of increasingly protectionist trade policy. “Even though the level of rare earth elements in coal ash is relatively low when compared with those mined from geological deposits, the fact that the ash is readily available in large quantities makes it an attractive resource,” the University of Texas at Austin News reports . However, not all coal ash is created equal. The concentration of rare earth elements is higher in the coal ash from some regions than from others, with coal ash from the Appalachian Basin having the richest concentrations at 431 milligrams per kilogram. However, higher concentrations doesn’t mean higher extraction rates. Interesting Engineering reports that within Appalachian Basin coal ash, only 30 percent of the critical minerals are easily recoverable. Meanwhile, coal ash from the Powder River Basin only has 264 milligrams per kilogram, but 70 percent extractability, making it a more economically viable option. Ramping up a domestic refining industry to recover critical minerals from coal ash would yield multiple benefits, both economic and environmental. “By modifying existing treatment processes, we can address multiple problems,” says Sarma Pisupati, director of the Center for Critical Minerals at Penn State. Those include “getting the material we need for national security and remediating long-standing environmental problems at the same time.” By Haley Zaremba for Oilprice.com More Top Reads From Oilprice.com U.S. Utilities Face Peak Demand Uncertainty With Data Center Boom Sierra Leone Stakes Next Oil Frontier Claim Ofgem Unveils £24 Billion Grid Modernization Plan Read this article on OilPrice.com"

Analysis-Foreign investors increase dollar hedges on US stock portfolios,2025-07-02 04:58:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysis-foreign-investors-increase-dollar-195818289.html,"By Laura Matthews NEW YORK (Reuters) -Overseas asset managers and pensions are adding protection against a weakening dollar, concerned about the U.S. currency's diminishing ability to diversify their U.S. equity portfolios. Because such stock funds carry built-in dollar exposure, investors with other home currencies that had not neutralized the foreign exchange risk were cushioned when the dollar was strong if Wall Street performed badly. But the dollar's correlation with other U.S. assets, and the impact of its fall on portfolio performance, came into sharper focus when the Trump administration announced far-reaching global tariffs on April 2, sending U.S. stock indexes and the greenback sharply lower. The dollar hit a three-year low against a basket of currencies, raising risks for investors whose portfolios once benefited from the natural hedge. Now, managers are reducing dollar exposures and increasing the hedge ratios for U.S. stock portfolios where clients' investment policies allow them to do so. About 10% of Russell Investments pension fund clients in Europe and the UK have already increased hedge ratios on their international stock portfolios, said Van Luu, global head of solutions strategy for fixed income and foreign exchange for Russell in London. One client raised it to 75% from 50%, highlighting the desire to have a greater portion of U.S. stocks protected against the weakening dollar. ""If what we're seeing persists... then you will have more clients taking action in that direction,"" said Luu. 'MORE HOSTILE' The dollar is down 10% for the year, and 6.5% since U.S. President Donald Trump's so-called Liberation Day in April. Meanwhile, the S&P 500, the benchmark U.S. stock index, has recovered 24% since an April slump and is up 5.3% this year, flirting with record highs. The MSCI gauge of global stocks, minus the U.S., has risen 16% for the year. ""It's not enough to look at the stock market and say it is more or less back to where it was, so nothing happened,"" said Peter Vassallo, FX portfolio manager at BNP Paribas Asset Management, who manages currency exposures across its asset classes. BNP has been reducing dollar exposures for its clients that include pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and central banks. It has sold U.S. dollars across stock and fixed income portfolios, and built up what Vassallo described as a sizable position in options for funds that allow these strategies. He said the euro, yen and the Australian dollar are among the primary currencies it bought against the dollar, a big contrast to how the asset manager ended the previous year with a small ""overweight"" in the U.S. dollar. ""This switch towards a more uncertain policy regime created an environment where we as market participants see the U.S. as more hostile to international capital flows, international trading,"" Vassallo said. After a June review, Justin Onuekwusi, chief investment officer at St. James's Place, said it is maintaining a strategic hedge that allows it to reduce overseas currency exposure in favor of the pound by up to 20%. The strategy ""has been beneficial for our clients' returns year to date,"" he said. Onuekwusi said he now sees the dollar as closer to its longer-term fair value and has marginally reduced dollar hedging across managed portfolios. Foreign investors hold more than $30 trillion in U.S. securities, about $17 trillion of which is in equities and more than $12 trillion in long-term debt, according to data published in April by the U.S. Treasury Department. Marcus Fernandes, global head of currency management at Northern Trust, said the divergence in the correlation of risk is more than in the past. ""That's why people are thinking faster than before, 'I need to increase my hedge ratio',"" he said. ""Once those conversations start, they usually end with increased hedge ratios,"" he said. COST INCENTIVE Data from Russell showed that a euro-hedged version of the MSCI USA index was flat for the year through May, while the euro-unhedged version was down 8.3%, showing the benefit of hedging for euro-based investors. The dollar is down 13% against the euro on concerns about flip-flopping U.S. trade policies and growth. ""FX is back on the boardroom agenda,"" said Joe McKenna, head of fund solutions at MillTech, a London-based FX and cash management company. ""What was once handled quietly in the back office is now drawing the attention of CIOs and CFOs, driven by renewed dollar volatility."" Managers hedge currency exposure by selling the dollar against their respective base currency like the euro or the pound in the FX forwards market, and also use derivatives like options. When the dollar weakens, the hedge position gains in value while the dollar exposure on the underlying stock portfolio loses. Forward selling of the dollar is the largest in four years, according to John Velis, Americas macro strategist at BNY Markets, suggesting investors are unwilling to carry long dollar exposures, even with the potential for it to rally if U.S. tariff policy changes or the Israel-Iran conflict resumes. Investors reallocating to U.S. assets to meet benchmark weights after April's selloff are now hedging those exposures, he told Reuters. ""It communicates that dollar volatility is a concern,"" said Velis. ""It can be policy volatility as well as macroeconomic volatility that's causing people to... not keep that dollar exposure because of the fears of the dollar decline.""

Court approves sale of 23andMe to nonprofit led by co-founder Anne Wojcicki,2025-07-02 04:53:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/court-approves-sale-23andme-nonprofit-195321692.html,"23andMe's office building in Mountain View, Calif. (Smith Collection / Gado / Getty Images) 23andMe, a distressed genetic testing company that filed for bankruptcy this year, has received another potential lifeline. A bankruptcy judge approved the sale of the company's assets and business operations to a nonprofit led by 23andMe's co-founder and former chief executive, Anne Wojcicki. The nonprofit, TTAM Research Institute, will pay $305 million as part of the deal that will probably close in the coming weeks. The South San Francisco company's financial turmoil sparked privacy concerns over what happens to the genetic data of its 13 million customers if it's sold. These worries prompted 1.9 million users to delete their accounts. Several states , including California, sued to block the sale of 23andMe's data without user consent, arguing that customers have an inherent right to their own genetic information. Unlike a password, a person's genetic data can't be changed if compromised. Read more: 23andMe bankruptcy leaves control of genetic data from millions in limbo Judge Brian Walsh of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Eastern District of Missouri, in St. Louis, said in an opinion filed Friday that ""a company’s sale of genetic data is a scary proposition, and reasonable people might conclude that it should not be permitted in any circumstances."" But the proposed sale means that Wojcicki would repurchase a business that she helped start and led for years. And she ""will improve privacy practices while honoring customers’ rights to delete their accounts and data,"" the judge said. “Core to my beliefs is that individuals should be empowered to have choice and transparency with respect to their genetic data and have the opportunity to continue to learn about their ancestry and health risks as they wish,"" Wojcicki said in a statement . The entrepreneur has tried to pave the way forward for 23andMe several times in the past. Before 23andMe filed for bankruptcy, the company's special committee rejected Wojcicki's proposal to take the company private by acquiring all of the company’s outstanding shares. The company's stock plunged before it filed for bankruptcy. Wojcicki stepped down from her role as chief executive but remained on 23andMe's board. Earlier, drugmaker Regeneron Pharmaceuticals was set to buy 23andMe. Then a bankruptcy judge reopened the bidding process to allow for a bid from TTAM, which offered a higher price. Weighing arguments from states opposed to the sale, Walsh noted that 23andMe's privacy statement says its users' personal information could be sold as part of a merger, acquisition or sale of the company's assets. Under the deal, TTAM would make employment offers to 23andMe workers and genetic data wouldn't be disclosed to new parties, according to the court filing. Once valued at $6 billion, 23andMe filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March. Founded in 2006, the company sells DNA testing kits that people use to learn about their ancestry and health. The company struggled with recurring revenue growth because people just took the DNA test once. It also faced privacy concerns. In 2023, hackers obtained personal information of roughly 7 million customers. Some of the data accessed included ancestry trees, birth years and geographic locations, highlighting the risks that come with handing over data to private companies. In an email sent to customers after the sale was approved, 23andMe said that TTAM is committed to adhering to the company's privacy policy and that customers have the right to opt out of research or delete their accounts.

Google’s data center energy use doubled in 4 years,2025-07-02 04:52:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-data-center-energy-doubled-195239038.html,"Sunnyvale, California, USA - April 4, 2018: Headquarters for Google Cloud computing, located at 1155 Borregas Ave, Sunnyvale, CA 94089. | Image Credits:JasonDoiy / Getty Images No wonder Google is desperate for more power: The company’s data centers more than doubled their electricity use in just four years. The eye-popping stat comes from Google’s most recent sustainability report , which it released late last week. In 2024, Google data centers used 30.8 million megawatt-hours of electricity. That’s up from 14.4 million megawatt-hours in 2020, the earliest year Google broke out data center consumption. Google has pledged to use only carbon-free sources of electricity to power its operations, a task made more challenging by its breakneck pace of data center growth. And the company’s electricity woes are almost entirely a data center problem. In 2024, data centers accounted for 95.8% of the entire company’s electron budget. Image Credits: Tim De Chant/TechCrunch The company’s ratio of data-center-to-everything-else has been remarkably consistent over the last four years. Though 2020 is the earliest year Google has made data center electricity consumption figures available, it’s possible to use that ratio to extrapolate back in time. Some quick math reveals that Google’s data centers likely used just over 4 million megawatt-hours of electricity in 2014. That’s sevenfold growth in just a decade. The tech company has already picked most of the low-hanging fruit by improving the efficiency of its data centers. Those efforts have paid off, and the company is frequently lauded for being at the leading edge. But as the company’s power usage effectiveness (PUE) has approached the theoretical ideal of 1.0, progress has slowed. Last year, Google’s company-wide PUE dropped to 1.09, a 0.01 improvement over 2023 but only 0.02 better than a decade ago. It’s clear that Google needs more electricity, and to keep to its carbon-free pledge, it has been investing heavily in a range of energy sources, including geothermal, both flavors of nuclear power, and renewables. Geothermal shows promise for data center operations. By tapping into Earth’s heat, enhanced geothermal power plants can consistently generate electricity regardless of the weather. And many startups, including Google-backed Fervo Energy , are making it possible to drill profitable wells in more places. On the nuclear fusion side, Google last week announced it would invest in Commonwealth Fusion Systems and buy 200 megawatts of electricity from its forthcoming Arc power plant, scheduled to come online in the early 2030s. In the nuclear fission world, Google has pledged to buy 500 megawatts of electricity from Kairos Power , a small modular reactor startup. The nuclear deals have yet to deliver power — and they won’t for five years or more. In the meantime, the company has been on a renewable energy buying spree. In May, the company bought 600 megawatts of solar capacity in South Carolina, and in January, it announced a deal for 700 megawatts of solar in Oklahoma . Google said in 2024 it was working with Intersect Power and TPG Rise Climate to build several gigawatts’ worth of carbon-free power plants, a $20 billion investment. The outlay isn’t surprising given that solar and (to a lesser extent) wind are the only two sources of power that are readily available before the end of the decade. New nuclear power plants take years to permit and build, and even the most optimistic timelines don’t see them connecting to the grid or a data center before the end of the decade. Natural gas, which the U.S. has plenty of, is hamstrung by five-plus-year waitlists for new turbines. That leaves renewables paired with battery storage. Google has contracted with enough renewables to match its total consumption, though those sources don’t always deliver electrons when and where the company needs them. “When we announced to the world that we would achieve that 100% annual matching goal, we were very clear that wasn’t the end state,” Michael Terrell, Google’s head of advanced energy, told reporters last week. “The end game was 24/7 carbon-free energy around the clock everywhere we operate at all times.” Google has some work to do. Worldwide, the company has about 66% of its data center consumption, matched to the hour, powered by carbon-free electricity. But that average papers over some regional challenges. While its Latin American data centers hit 92% last year, its Middle East and Africa facilities are only at 5%. Those hurdles are part of why Google is investing in stable, carbon-free sources like fission and fusion, Terrell said. “In order for us to eventually reach this goal, we are going to have to have these technologies,” he said."

"Figma reveals revenue, profit growth in US IPO filing",2025-07-02 04:43:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cloud-based-designer-platform-figma-194307161.html,"(Reuters) -Figma disclosed higher revenue and profit for the first three months of 2025, as the cloud-based designer platform prepares to list on the NYSE more than a year after its $20 billion planned sale to Adobe was scrapped. The company's IPO is poised to be one of the most high-profile listings this year, signaling that concerns stirred by U.S. tariffs are quickly fading in the wake of a scorching equities rally. Last year, Figma was valued at $12.5 billion in a tender offer that allowed its employees and early investors to cash out some of their stake. Figma's IPO was widely expected after antitrust regulators in Europe and the UK blocked Adobe's acquisition. In December 2023, the companies mutually shelved the deal, which would have been one of the biggest acquisitions of a software startup. Figma, meanwhile, has been working to strengthen its financial footing. It reported $228.2 million in revenue for the three months ended March 31, compared with $156.2 million a year earlier, and its net income jumped three-fold to $44.9 million. The company is also sharpening its focus on AI. While spending on the technology could weigh on Figma's ""efficiency"" for several years, the company will keep doubling down on the technology, co-founder and CEO Dylan Field wrote in a letter attached to the filing. ""Expect us to take big swings when we see a chance to invest in our platform or pursue M&A at scale. That means at times we will make decisions that may not seem immediately rational,"" he added. The company plans to use part of the proceeds to repay borrowings under its revolving credit facility, which it expects to draw to cover upcoming tax payments.

Automattic puts Tumblr migration to WordPress on hold,2025-07-02 04:13:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/automattic-puts-tumblr-migration-wordpress-191315925.html,"Image Credits:Automattic Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg confirmed that the company is no longer working on migrating its Tumblr blogging platform to WordPress, as previously announced. The exec shared the news on The Verge’s Decoder podcast , published on Monday, saying that the project is “on hold” for an indefinite period. “What we decided is that we want to focus as much on the things that are going to be noticeable to users and that users are asking for,” he told the site. “This was more like an infrastructure thing, kind of like any big re-architecture. I still want to do it. It’s just cleaner. But right now, we’re not working on it.” The announcement also raises questions about what this means for Tumblr’s integration with the open social web, known as the fediverse. By migrating its infrastructure to WordPress, it would have become a federated app. Mullenweg admits that was one of the arguments for making the move, but hints that it’s no longer a priority. “…in the meantime, I think if there was a big push to implement fediverse, we would just do it on the Tumblr code base,” he said. Mullenweg also reiterated that Tumblr is not profitable, and is sustained from the profits of other Automattic products. Still, he said he believed in Tumblr’s future and plans to give it the runway it needs to figure things out."
US economy 'on wobbly footing': Why Wall Street strategists are cautious about stock market's recent records,2025-07-02 16:57:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-on-wobbly-footing-why-wall-street-strategists-are-cautious-about-stock-markets-recent-records-185429502.html,"Stocks staged a historic comeback from their April lows, finishing the first half of the year on a high note with the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) and Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) securing back-to-back all-time records. A large part of the market's gains has hinged on easing geopolitical tensions and tariff-related deescalations, including the emergence of the so-called TACO trade, an acronym for ""Trump Always Chickens Out."" The phrase captures a belief among some investors that the president often talks tough on tariffs but rarely follows through. That assumption has helped fuel a tailwind for markets in recent months as traders increasingly bet on last-minute policy pivots. Trade deal frameworks with China and the UK are reportedly now on the table ahead of Trump's self-imposed July 9 deadline. This has led investors to price in a ""Goldilocks scenario"" for stocks, with sustained earnings growth, little effects from tariffs, and rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. But Wall Street pros are signaling caution as they assess the path forward, which still includes many unknowns. Stocks kicked off the second half with a mixed close on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 pulling back from record highs as the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) rose. ""Just as Goldilocks awoke from her sleep to confront three bears, there are several areas where this optimism is likely to be challenged,"" JPMorgan's economics and policy team, led by Bruce Kasman, wrote in a recent client note. Kasman cautioned investors not to ""get carried away by inflation momentum,"" warning that tariffs are still set to rise despite ongoing trade negotiations . This will add pressure to a US economy already grappling with softer consumer demand and signs of stalling global factory activity. Read more: How to protect your money during turmoil, stock market volatility ""The economy is entering the second half of the year on wobbly footing,"" Comerica Bank chief economist Bill Adams added. The uncertainty has been exacerbated by mixed economic signals, including a downward revision to first-quarter GDP growth, a slight uptick in PCE inflation , and continued claims reaching their highest level since 2021, indicating some labor market softness. ""There are some yellow flags in the economy but no clear red flags yet,"" Aditya Bhave, senior US economist at Bank of America, said on a call with reporters. ""We're at a fork in the road,"" he said. ""If something is going to break, it's going to break soon."" President Trump speaks to the media before walking across the South Lawn of the White House to board Marine One en route to Joint Base Andrews, Md., and on to Florida on July 1. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) · ASSOCIATED PRESS But markets have mostly shrugged off those fears in favor of more optimistic indicators. The latest data released on Tuesday, for example, showed job openings unexpectedly rose in May to hit the highest level since November 2024. Additionally, economists have said easing inflation in areas like housing and energy may help offset tariff-related price increases. ""If the Fed cuts in the second half of 2025, it is more likely because inflation is lower than expected than because the unemployment rate rises more than expected,"" Adams said. To cut or not to cut? The timing of Fed rate cuts remains one of the most hotly debated topics heading into the second half of the year as President Trump continues to pressure the central bank to slash interest rates. ""We still think cuts in the next two meetings are unlikely,” Morgan Stanley economists wrote in a note this week. It's a reality markets may struggle to accept, with futures pricing in nearly a 100% chance of a cut by September. Instead, Morgan Stanley sees the Fed delivering seven rate cuts in 2026, helped by the expected arrival of a more dovish Fed chair following Jerome Powell’s departure early next year. Read more: How the Fed rate decision affects your bank accounts, loans, credit cards, and investments JPMorgan echoed that caution, saying the Fed is unlikely to ease unless private payroll growth dips ""well below 100,000"" in the next two reports. Bloomberg consensus estimates call for a 110,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls for June and a slight uptick in the unemployment rate to 4.3%. ""The risks of this outcome have increased,"" JPMorgan wrote, ""but our forecast for next week's June report — 125,000 jobs added and a 4.3% unemployment rate — should keep the Fed in its current cautious waiting mode."" To that point, Powell has consistently emphasized the central bank's ability to remain patient as it assesses the economic fallout from rising tariffs. ""The size of the impact with this type of shock that we haven't had probably in close to 100 years is very hard to have certainty on,"" Claudio Irigoyen, head of global economics at Bank of America, said on a midyear outlook call with reporters on Tuesday. He added that ""uncertainty is worse than bad news,"" explaining that businesses ""cannot commit to long-term investment when the rules of the game are not clear.""

The legislation — which is expected to widen the deficit by $3.3 trillion over the next decade — now heads to the House. If it passes, that could benefit gold’s appeal as a haven. Investors were also focused on the US June employment report due Thursday. The figures are expected to show a slowdown in payrolls growth and uptick in unemployment, which may bolster the case for cuts by the Fed. It would follow a stronger-than-expected job openings print on Tuesday that reduced hopes for a July cut. Lower borrowing costs tend to benefit the non-yielding commodity. Gold is up by more than a quarter this year, and is trading around $170 short of a record set in April, supported by demand for havens as investors grappled with heightened geopolitical and trade tensions. The rally has also been supported robust central-bank purchases, as well as inflows into bullion-backed exchange-traded funds. Meanwhile, investors continued to monitor US trade talks, with Trump saying he was not considering delaying a July 9 deadline for higher tariffs. Still, there are signs that traders are becoming less worried by the president’s unpredictable stance on levies, as the economy remains broadly healthy.

Trump’s 35% Tariff Threat Feeds Japan’s Worst-Case Scenario Fear,2025-07-02 16:09:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-35-tariff-threat-feeds-070954356.html,"(Bloomberg) -- US President Donald Trump threatened Japan with tariffs of up to 35% as he ramped up tensions for a third straight day, fueling fears of a worst-case scenario among market players and raising doubts over Tokyo’s tactics in trade talks. Most Read from Bloomberg Struggling Downtowns Are Looking to Lure New Crowds Sprawl Is Still Not the Answer California Exempts Building Projects From Environmental Law What Gothenburg Got Out of Congestion Pricing Japan should be forced to “pay 30%, 35% or whatever the number is that we determine, because we also have a very big trade deficit with Japan,” Trump said, again flagging the possibility that across-the-board tariffs could go much higher than the 24% initially penciled in for July 9. “I’m not sure we’re going to make a deal. I doubt it with Japan, they’re very tough. You have to understand, they’re very spoiled.” Market participants and analysts warned against taking Trump’s comments at face value and suggested that some kind of deal will eventually get done. But they also warned that Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s government may need to change tack from a friendly and firm stance that is now leading the two sides to brinkmanship. “There is some risk of a US tantrum that results in higher punitive actions by Washington this month,” said Kurt Tong, a former senior US diplomat in Asia who’s now a managing partner at the Asia Group. “If that happens, Japan may have no choice but to hit back with its own specific countermeasures.” Trump’s latest threat fits in with a high-pressure deal-making strategy that sometimes results in big last-minute concessions on both sides, as seen with China, but market players still need to game out how to position themselves should talks founder. While few analysts see Japan’s stocks collapsing on a no-deal scenario, some of them forecast the Nikkei 225 to fall into the 38,000 range, a decline of more than 4%, rather than rallying above 40,000 if there’s an agreement. The Nikkei 225 edged down 0.6% to close at 39,762 on Wednesday while the yen was trading at 143.88 against the dollar, down around 0.3%. Japan has so far stood firm in negotiations over across-the-board reciprocal tariffs, insisting that they be removed along with additional sectoral tariffs on autos, steel and aluminum. The car duties are particularly painful for Japan as the industry contributes the equivalent of almost 10% of gross domestic product and employs around 8% of the workforce. Tokyo has insisted that a “win-win” deal must encompass all the tariffs in one go with Ishiba preferring no deal to a bad deal ahead of a July 20 upper house election. The prime minister on Wednesday reiterated his view that focusing on jobs and investment in the US was the way forward, just like it was for Nippon Steel as it patiently sought to change Trump’s view and take over US Steel. “Japan is the biggest global investor in the US and the world’s biggest contributor to US jobs,” Ishiba said in Tokyo on Wednesday. “That means Japan is different from other countries.” But as July 9 gets closer, some observers say more needs to be done to convince the US to back off. “We have to work on Trump himself, to first try to avoid the tariffs to be imposed from July 9,” said Ichiro Fujisaki, former Japanese ambassador to the US, adding that the president’s remarks show that Tokyo hasn’t brought enough to the table yet. “We don’t have something like rare earths but the US is dependent on Japanese industry as well. About half of materials for making semiconductors come from Japanese industry,” Fujisaki said, pointing to a possible area of leverage, too. In the meantime, market players are evaluating the potential scale of the fallout. “There is a lot more risk of things falling apart than is being priced in by the market,” said Zuhair Khan, a fund manager at UBP Investments. “There is always the risk of a policy blunder by either side.” He points to the 32,000 Nikkei level on the day Trump first announced the reciprocal tariffs. “If the probability of a no deal is 25% then the Nikkei should be at 38,000.” What Bloomberg Economics Says... “If Japan is ultimately forced to pay reciprocal tariffs at those rates, on top of the 24% rate announced on ‘Liberation Day’ — currently suspended at 10% — the macroeconomic fallout would be sizable. Our estimate through a model of global trade suggests a medium-term GDP hit of around 1.2%, roughly double the 0.6% drag expected under the current levy.” — Taro Kimura, economist For the full report, click here. The point of imposing a deadline in negotiations is to create an opportunity for leverage, so it’s not surprising to see Trump pushing high tariffs as a threat to push for better deals as the date approaches, said Phillip Wool, head of portfolio management at Rayliant Global Advisors Ltd. “There’s also an element of political theater here, as Trump’s narrative to American voters is that the US has been bullied on trade for so long, and there’s clearly a desire to look ‘tough’ on trade,” Wool said. “But there has to be a face-saving deal at some point so that it looks like the negotiation was truly a success as opposed to the mutually assured destruction of impasse and perpetually high tariffs.” Like some other market players, Wool is wary of an overly pessimistic knee-jerk response to each remark Trump makes. If there is a big selloff in a worst-case scenario, Wool sees it as a great buying opportunity for long-term, active investors. Strategists are split on how a bad scenario might play out for the yen. While some such as SBI Liquidity Market Co.’s Marito Ueda see the possibility of risk aversion sparking a strengthening of Japan’s currency to the 138 range against the dollar, others see a weakening as more likely. A stalemate in trade talks would likely delay the Bank of Japan’s next interest rate hike, especially if it led to tariffs of up to 35% in the meantime, said Akira Moroga, chief market strategist at Aozora Bank. Movement would slow after the 145 mark, making a push past 147 difficult, he said. Still, the consensus is that a deal will be reached sooner or later, and that Japan will have to concede more ground to achieve it. “If it’s concluded I don’t think it’s going to be a win-win situation,” said Fujisaki. “Maybe a capital-letter ‘WIN’ for US, but a small letter ‘win’ for Japan.” --With assistance from Momoka Yokoyama, Toshiro Hasegawa, Umesh Desai, Hidenori Yamanaka, Mari Kiyohara, Aya Wagatsuma and Akemi Terukina.

The large-language models that run the data and produce output need a tremendous amount of power for these processes, training on millions of data points that are constantly updated and running through tons of algorithms to create accurate content and images. Nvidia's chips make that happen. Image source: Getty Images. Since so many tech companies want to use generative AI in their operations today, Nvidia's chips are in great demand. Although there are alternatives, Nvidia has between 70% and 95% of the market, depending on who you ask. Even at the lower end, that's a huge lead over the competition. As the gold standard, Nvidia is relied upon by the biggest companies like Microsoft and Amazon as a partner. This is where the greatest opportunity is. Amazon, for one, has its own line of budget options for smaller companies, but the large, brand-name clients it services need Nvidia's powerful chips. The demand is only expected to increase. According to Statista, the AI opportunity is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 26.6% over the next five years, reaching $1 trillion. A huge portion of that is likely to go to Nvidia. Management continues to launch new products that can handle higher data loads, making them more attractive to clients. Its Blackwell technology, which launched last year to replace the Hopper architecture, is already moving into Blackwell Ultra, and management is planning to release a new range of chips next year under the Rubin name. Nvidia is unstoppable In the near term, Nvidia continues to report phenomenal results despite serious setbacks. U.S. regulations mean it can't ship its best chips to China, stymying progress in that market, and Nvidia took a hit to its earnings in the fiscal 2026 first quarter (ended April 27) related to a charge for orders it couldn't fulfill. Yet the first-quarter results were outstanding. Revenue increased 69% year over year, and earnings per share (EPS) were up from $0.60 last year to $0.76 this year, inclusive of the one-time charge. Management is guiding for growth to decelerate in the second quarter but remain high at a 50% increase year over year. Wall Street is looking for EPS of $1, up from $0.68 last year. For the full year, Wall Street is expecting $200 billion in revenue and $4.29 in EPS, up from $130 billion (a 54% increase) and $2.99 (a 43% increase) over last year. The valuation can handle it If the valuation remains constant, Nvidia stock will rise along with its earnings. If it rises 54% from where it started out this year, it will reach $212. If it rises 43%, it will reach $197. If nothing much changes and Nvidia meets Wall Street's expectations, the stock should surpass $200 by the end of the year. However, Nvidia tends to beat expectations. If that happens, it could rise further. High-growth stocks can also carry higher valuations. If Nvidia's valuation rises, the price could also rise further. At the current price, Nvidia stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 50 and a price-to-sales ratio of 26. Those aren't cheap numbers, but they're pretty reasonable for Nvidia's growth. The likelihood is that Nvidia hits at least $200 before the end of the year, or shoots 27% higher than the price at the time of this writing. Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

How Volatility Indexes Can Help Investors Gauge Bear Market Bottoms,2025-07-02 10:10:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/volatility-indexes-help-investors-gauge-011000472.html,"Key Points Investors of all types prepare for potential pullbacks differently than they prepare for bullishness. Namely, they're willing to pay a premium for options, which are an effective means of playing defense. This demand for defensive option positions, however, often peaks right as the market's making a buy-worthy bottom. 10 stocks we like better than CBOE S&P 500 Volatility Index › Invest in Gold Priority Gold: Up to $15k in Free Silver + Zero Account Fees on Qualifying Purchase Learn More American Hartford Gold: #1 Precious Metals Dealer in the Nation Learn More Thor Metals Group: Best Overall Gold IRA Learn More Powered by Money.com - Yahoo may earn commission from the links above. Most experienced investors will agree that timing the market is difficult to do very well for very long. Eventually, you're just going to be thrown an unexpected curveball that unwinds all of your success. Not even most pros can do it with any consistency. Standard & Poor's reports that in any given year, on average, more than three-fourths of actively managed large-cap mutual funds available to U.S. investors underperform their S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) benchmark. That's why buying and holding index funds into and through bear markets is such a popular strategy -- it's the one that's most likely to yield the biggest net returns. What if, however, investors just aren't using the right market-timing tools the right way? Well, this may be the case. The so-called volatility indexes actually offer reliable hints of when the stock market is near or at a buy-worthy low. You just need to understand how to read these clues, and appreciate that they're only an odds-making tool that isn't laser-precise. Here's what you need to know. What's a volatility index? A volatility index is simply a measure of prices for a basket of put and call options . Both call and put option prices tend to rise in anticipation of near-term volatility, so when a volatility index rises, it's a hint that investors -- professional and individual alike -- expect the market to become more erratic in the foreseeable future. And there are two key ones: the S&P 500 Volatility Index , or VIX, and the Nasdaq Volatility Index , or VXN. (The underlying stock options used to determine each of their ever-changing values is pretty clear.) Except, that's not quite how the use of either volatility index has evolved over the last few decades. When market volatility is working bullishly in stocks' favor, the VIX and VXN tend to remain at low levels. Curiously, as it turns out, they only tend to rise to unusually high levels when investors are fearful of a market pullback, and are hedging against that pullback using options. That's why the S&P 500 Volatility Index has since come to be known as the fear gauge. And this nuance makes for a powerful market-timing tool. See, the VXN and VIX tend to reach unusually high levels when investor fear is peaking at a major market low. A solid track record of prediction As the old adage goes, a picture is worth a thousand words. Three pictures are worth even more. Take a look at the first image below, comparing the S&P 500 to the VIX between 1997 and 1999. This period, of course, includes the sizable panic-driven sell-off in July and August of 1998, when Russia's government defaulted on its debts. That development created a ripple effect that swept across the global economy, upending stocks as a result. While it was a terrifying time, as you can see, it was also a short-lived setback. Also note how the VIX was behaving around that same time. In July of that year, the VIX reached a record high, suggesting that almost all would-be sellers were already flushed out. ^SPX data by YCharts . We saw similar action between 2000 and 2003, when the bear market following the dot-com craze of the late-1990s took hold and wouldn't let go. The VIX finally jumped to a multiyear high in mid-2002, and the S&P 500 started laying the groundwork for a reversal of the then-bear market shortly thereafter. ^SPX data by YCharts . And the Nasdaq's volatility index has been just as telling. Although the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) remained in bear market mode for the entirety of 2022, note that its volatility index's upward thrusts that year didn't get progressively higher. It was a subtle hint that the selling wasn't going to persist for nearly as long as it felt like it might at the time. And the VXN was also particularly telling in April this year, soaring to a multiyear high at the same time the composite itself was making a major low. ^IXIC data by YCharts . What gives? These charts underscore the argument that most traders just aren't great at short-term market-timing. They were making their most bearish and defensive option-based bets right before or right at the market's major capitulations. A tool with limitations, but a powerful tool nonetheless While it's clearly capable of being a powerful market-timing tool, you must understand the big downside of using the volatility indexes in this manner. That's the fact that it requires some subjective interpretation. See, there is no absolute VIX or VXN level that's ""too high."" The 40 mark seems to be one the VXN regularly reaches at buy-worthy bottoms, while the S&P 500 often makes key lows when the VIX gets near 30. There are some huge exceptions to these numbers, though, like 2009's low. The VIX jumped to nearly 80 before that bottom was in. It also jumped months before that. While most of the bear market was already in the rearview mirror by that point, that could have been a scary few more months to simply sit on stocks. As mentioned earlier, volatility indexes aren't unfailingly precise. They'll probably never flag the exact market low, in fact, and even when they do, that won't become clear until after the fact. In most instances you'll be making some sort of judgment call on a volatility index, taking a leap of faith as a result. Nevertheless, the Nasdaq Volatility Index as well as the S&P 500 Volatility Index are both powerful additions to an investor's odds-making toolkit. That is to say, if you understand that a clear spike to an unusually high level is often seen at points of capitulation, the VIX and VXN can certainly help confirm other clues that a sell-off has run most -- if not all -- of its course. And when it comes to investing, even gaining a small edge is a pretty big deal. Should you invest $1,000 in CBOE S&P 500 Volatility Index right now?

Forget Energy Transfer? The Smartest High Yield Energy Stocks to Buy With $100 Right Now,2025-07-02 10:05:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-energy-transfer-smartest-high-010500137.html,"Key Points The energy sector is known for being volatile. Geopolitical issues have left oil prices in an uncertain state. Investors can sidestep much of the energy sector's volatility with these two high yield stocks. 10 stocks we like better than Energy Transfer › Geopolitics is a risk for the markets that never seems to go away. It is a particularly acute issue for the energy sector, with a lot of oil coming out of the often geopolitically tense Middle East. This dynamic is clearly in the headlines today. But you can invest in the energy sector in a way that minimizes such risks. Here are two high-yield ways to do just that while you collect yields of up to 6.9%. The energy sector has three parts; only two are highly volatile The energy sector is largely broken down into three parts: the upstream, the midstream, and the downstream. The upstream is where oil and natural gas are produced. This segment is highly impacted by energy price swings. The downstream is where oil and natural gas get processed into chemicals and refined products, like gasoline. Oil and natural gas are key inputs, so commodity price swings have a huge impact on this segment. That said, many chemicals and refined products are also commodities, so there's often a double impact from commodity volatility in the downstream. Image source: Getty Images. The midstream is the big exception in the energy sector. Midstream companies own energy infrastructure like pipelines , storage, and transportation assets. These assets basically connect the upstream to the downstream and the rest of the world. Since most of the activity in this segment is really tied to moving energy commodities around, midstream companies tend to charge fees for the use of their assets. Demand for energy is more important than the price of energy in this business model. Demand for energy tends to be robust regardless of commodity prices because of how important energy is to modern life. All in, midstream companies generally have fairly reliable cash flows. That allows midstream companies to pay out generous dividends and support those dividends through the swings that frequently take place in the price of oil and natural gas. Investors looking for energy exposure without all of the geopolitical price risk should look at midstream players like Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD) and Enbridge (NYSE: ENB) . But not all midstream companies are equally reliable, as the dividend histories behind Kinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI) and Energy Transfer (NYSE: ET) highlight. Each one of these high-yield stocks trades for well less than $100 a share. Reliability is key for Enterprise and Enbridge There are two stats that make Enterprise and Enbridge attractive income investments. The first is yield, with Enterprise offering a distribution yield of roughly 6.9% and Enbridge a dividend yield of about 6.1%. That said, these aren't the only high-yield midstream businesses you can buy. For example, Energy Transfer has an even higher yield of 7.2%. Before you jump on that lofty yield, you should take a look at 2020, which was a difficult one for oil prices thanks to the economic shutdowns used to slow the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. That was the year that Energy Transfer cut its distribution. Energy Transfer isn't the only midstream dividend stock to worry about. Kinder Morgan, which offers a lower 4% yield, fell short of its plans to raise its dividend by 25% in 2020, offering just a 5% hike instead. That seems reasonable, given the economic backdrop, but it comes after a dividend cut in 2016, the last time oil prices were in the dumps. And in 2016, Kinder Morgan cut after telling investors to expect an increase of up to 10%. To be fair, both Kinder Morgan and Energy Transfer used their dividend cuts to improve their financial conditions. But both Enterprise and Enbridge increased their disbursements in 2016 and 2020. And both have long been conservatively run, including having investment-grade-rated balance sheets. A strong financial foundation and a conservative operating ethos have allowed Enterprise to increase its distribution annually for 26 consecutive years and Enbridge to raise its dividend each year for 30 years. That reliability is the second reason that these two high-yielders stand out from the pack. And if you are going to put your hard-earned cash to work, even if it's just $100, you should probably stick with companies you can trust. Enterprise and Enbridge are reliable high-yield energy stocks There are clearly nuances to the businesses behind Kinder Morgan, Energy Transfer, Enterprise, and Enbridge. Some investors may even prefer Kinder Morgan and Energy Transfer based on their specific businesses. But if you are looking for income stocks you can trust in the volatile energy sector, North American midstream giants Enterprise and Enbridge stand out on the reliability front. Add in their lofty yields, and the choice should be pretty easy whether you are investing $100 or $100,000. Should you invest $1,000 in Energy Transfer right now? Before you buy stock in Energy Transfer, consider this: The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Energy Transfer wasn’t one of them.

Should You Buy Microsoft Stock Now or Wait for a Dip?,2025-07-02 09:00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-microsoft-stock-now-wait-000000362.html,"Key Points Microsoft is trading at all-time highs and nearly 40 times its trailing earnings. Its growth rate has been higher than normal as the business has benefitted from artificial intelligence. 10 stocks we like better than Microsoft › Shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) are up 18% this year (returns as of June 27), and that has pushed the stock to a new all-time high. It's been a traditionally safe stock to own, but it's definitely expensive these days, trading at around 38 times its trailing earnings. The business has many growth opportunities and has been a big player in artificial intelligence (AI), which has investors bullish on its long-term future. But given its high valuation, should you consider waiting for a dip in price before adding the stock to your portfolio? Image source: Getty Images. Microsoft's stock is trading at a higher earnings multiple than its 10-year average Entering trading this week, Microsoft's valuation was at record levels, with a market cap of $3.7 trillion. It's one of the most highly valued stocks on the market today, trailing only Nvidia . But market cap alone doesn't tell investors if a stock is overpriced or not. Looking at a stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple can be an effective way to gauge its relative value. You can compare it to other stocks or even look at its historical average. And based on its 10-year average P/E, Microsoft does indeed look like an expensive stock right now. MSFT PE Ratio data by YCharts The stock doesn't look wildly expensive based on the above figure, but investors do appear to be paying a higher premium for the business these days. A higher P/E multiple can be justifiable if a business is performing particularly well and growing at a higher rate than normal, or if it has a big growth catalyst -- such as AI. Microsoft's growth rate has been higher than normal In recent years, Microsoft has expanded through its acquisition of video gaming company Activision-Blizzard and its heavy investments in AI. Currently, its AI business is generating revenue at an annual run rate of $13 billion, which is a modest amount for a tech company whose sales over the trailing 12 months have totaled $270 billion. MSFT Operating Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts There's still potentially much more growth ahead if demand for AI-powered PCs picks up. Unfortunately, with consumers scaling back on spending amid turbulent economic conditions, it may take some time before that may have any sizable impact on its operations. Should you buy Microsoft stock today? Microsoft is a good long-term investment, but I wouldn't buy it today. At such a high valuation, I don't think it's generating nearly enough growth to justify such a high premium, especially when there are many cheaper AI stocks to choose from ; there's not nearly a compelling enough reason to invest in Microsoft right now. I'd put the stock on a watch list, but I wouldn't buy it at its current valuation. There's not much margin of safety and if there's a slowdown in tech spending, especially if companies worry about an economic downturn, then there could be considerable room for the stock to fall.

Tesla Sank Today -- Is the Stock a Buy Right Now?,2025-07-02 08:00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-sank-today-stock-buy-230022286.html,"Key Points Tesla stock fell Tuesday in conjunction with multiple bearish catalysts. Elon Musk's feud with Trump was a factor in the sell-off, but concerns about vehicle shipments could have been a bigger factor. Tesla has plenty of long-term growth opportunities, but its near-term outlook seems challenging. These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires › Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock got hit with a substantial valuation pullback in Tuesday's trading. The electric vehicle (EV) leader's share price ended the daily session down 5%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) fell 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) fell 0.8%. News involving Tesla played a significant role in pushing the broader market lower in Tuesday's trading. After hitting record highs in Monday's session, some investors were likely already poised to take profits -- and another ramp-up in the feud between Elon Musk and President Trump prompted sell-offs for Tesla that had ripple effects for other tech stocks. Image source: Getty Images. Adding another bearish catalyst, the U.S. Senate passed President Trump's tax and budget bill without a provision that would have limited the ability of states to craft their own artificial intelligence ( AI ) regulations. With today's pullback, Tesla stock is now down 13% over the last month and roughly 26% across 2025's trading. Is Tesla stock a buy right now? While Tesla's robotaxi service has now launched in Austin, Texas, it could take a while for the business to scale substantially. Meanwhile, the core auto business faces the risk of sustained headwinds in the near term. Worsening relations between Trump and Musk could result in a less favorable growth backdrop for Tesla, but some valuation fundamentals look risky even if the tensions prove to be short-lived. Trading at roughly 10 times this year's expected sales and 161 times expected earnings, the company's valuation has some big wins already priced in, even as vehicle unit sales are seeing significant declines. Tesla has a strong track record and the foundations for ramping up its robotaxi and autonomous driving units, but a weaker sales outlook for its core EV business makes shares a risky play right now.

Exiting a very favorable Q2 for stocks, many of the underperformers are drawing investors’ attention, along with other names that still have “cheap” price tags. This leads us to discussing several top-rated internet stocks that fit this scenario and appear to be poised for more upside. Zacks Internet-Software Stocks: BMBL & CREX Among the top-rated Zacks Internet-Software Industry, Bumble BMBL and Creative Realities CREX are two stocks to watch with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), respectively. Furthermore, the Zacks Internet-Software Industry is currently in the top 16% of over 240 Zacks industries. Bumble stock has rebounded and climbed more than +50% over the last three months but is still more than 30% from its 52-week high of $10 a share. Operating two of the world’s highest-grossing dating apps (Badoo & Bumble), Bumble looks extremely undervalued and is already profitable after going public in 2021. Trading at just 7X forward earnings, Bumble is expecting high-double-digit EPS growth in fiscal 2025 and 10% EPS growth in FY26. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Meanwhile, Creative Realities is emerging as a leading marketing technologies company that provides a range of marketing technology solutions to its customers through its suite of software applications. At just $3 a share, Creative Realties' stock has also surged over +50% in the last three months. Expected to cross the profitability line this year after posting an adjusted loss of -$0.34 a share in 2024, Creative Realities stock trades at a very attractive 7X forward P/E multiple as well. Furthermore, the company’s steady top-line growth alludes to its future earnings potential, with total sales expected to rise 10% in FY25 and projected to increase another 13% in FY26 to $63.3 million.

Both have posted +20% gains in the last three months and are expecting over 10% growth on their top and bottom lines in FY25 and FY26. Most intriguing, Lyft shares still trade under $20 and at 14.3X forward earnings, with Crexendo stock trading at $6 and a reasonable 21.3X P/E multiple considering its growth.

Tech stocks saw a particularly pronounced pullback, with signs that President Trump's feud with Tesla CEO Elon Musk has picked up again, adding downside valuation pressure to the tech sector. Palantir stock also sold off in conjunction with a significant new development on the regulatory front. Image source: Getty Images. While the Senate voted to approve Trump's tax bill, it also removed a provision that would have prevented U.S. states from crafting their own AI regulations. Investors are generally betting that fewer regulations would be a bullish catalyst for Palantir and other artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, and the potential for states to craft their own legislative frameworks for AI caused investors to move out of the stock today. Is today's sell-off an opportunity to buy Palantir stock? Palantir's valuation pullback today highlights the potential for volatility created by the company's hugely growth-dependent valuation. There's no denying that the tech specialist has a strong position in the AI software space. It also seems clear that the company is on track to score big wins as demand catalysts continue to boost its performance in key markets. At the same time, some very strong growth is still priced into the stock. Trading at roughly 83 times this year's expected sales and 234 times expected earnings, Palantir has one of the most growth-dependent valuations of any large, profitable company on the market. While I think there's a good chance long-term shareholders will see strong returns above current levels, the valuation profile suggests that investors should approach the stock with the understanding that even minor performance shortfalls for the business could cause huge volatility.

Currency ETFs to Watch as the Dollar Struggles,2025-07-02 07:00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/currency-etfs-watch-dollar-struggles-220000809.html,"The greenback is losing its strength and trading near multi-year lows, marking its worst first-half performance since the 1970s. Mounting uncertainty over the Trump administration’s unpredictable tariff policies and U.S. debt level, are fueling investor anxiety and weighing on the greenback’s outlook. Both technical and fundamental factors are working against the greenback. According to TradingView, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has fallen 2.82% over the past month and 11.13% over the past six months. Greenback Under Pressure Amid Looming Rate Cuts The value of the greenback is closely related to the Fed’s monetary policies. The greenback's value tends to move inversely with interest rate adjustments by the Fed. Interest rate cuts by the Fed make the dollar less attractive to foreign investors, as this weakens it. Investors have increased their bet on the pace of interest rate cuts by the Fed, ahead of the series of U.S. economic data due this week, according to Reuters. Per analysts, a weak labor data could push the Fed to act sooner, accelerating dollar depreciation. Per the CME FedWatch tool, markets are anticipating a 97.7% likelihood of a rate cut in September. Goldman Sachs now anticipates three quarter-point rate cuts this year, up from just one cut, per the previous expectation, citing softening labor market trends and limited inflationary impact from tariffs, as quoted on Reuters. Leadership and political uncertainty of the Fed is a key headwind for the dollar’s standing as a global reserve currency, adding pressure on the greenback. Additionally, according to Reuters, investors are increasingly expecting the Fed to turn more aggressive next year, anticipating a potential leadership shake-up at the central bank. Other Market Moves According to FXEmpire, bearish projections from Goldman Sachs and UBS, coupled with increased institutional put positioning on the greenback, suggest the previous month’s sell-off may signal a sustained downturn in the dollar. The U.S. economy appears to be heading toward a slowdown, adding to downward pressure on the dollar. Increasing volatility in the economy has decreased investor appetite for U.S. assets, exerting further pressure on the greenback. A redirection of funds away from the United States reduces demand for the greenback, weakening it as a result and reducing its value. ETFs to Consider Investors can look to hedge themselves against the likelihood of the greenback depreciating and diversify their portfolios by increasing their exposure to the following mentioned funds. WisdomTree Emerging Currency Strategy Fund CEW WisdomTree Emerging Currency Strategy Fund employs an active strategy and provides exposure to various emerging currencies worldwide relative to the U.S. dollar, making it a quality fund to invest in. The fund has exposure to the currencies of South Korea, Mexico, South Africa, Brazil, Colombia and Poland, which comprise the top six countries, among others. CEW charges an annual fee of 0.55%. WisdomTree Emerging Currency Strategy Fund has gained 4.45% over the past three months and 7.03% over the past year. Invesco DB U.S. Dollar Index Bearish Fund UDN Invesco DB U.S. Dollar Index Bearish Fund offers exposure to a basket of currencies relative to the greenback, rising when the dollar depreciates. UDN is an appropriate option for investors with a bearish outlook on the U.S. dollar. Invesco DB U.S. Dollar Index Bearish Fund has gained 8.67% over the three months and 7.40% over the past year. UDN charges an annual fee of 0.78%. Investors can also look into the following funds that provide exposure to the basket of currencies tracked by the U.S. Dollar Index, relative to the greenback, rising when the dollar depreciates. Investors with a bearish outlook on the U.S. dollar can opt for these funds.

Investing in AI-Fueled Nuclear Resurgence,2025-07-02 06:42:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-ai-fueled-nuclear-resurgence-214200278.html,"(1:00) - President Trump's Recent Executive Order on Nuclear Power (8:05) - Big Tech's Push into Nuclear Energy (14:30) - Supply and Demand for Uranium and the Long-Term Impact (32:50) - Episode Roundup: NUKZ, NLR, URAN, URNM, URA Podcast@Zacks.com In this episode of ETF Spotlight, I speak with Tim Rotolo, Founder and CEO of Range Fund Holdings, about investing in the nuclear renaissance, which is being driven primarily by the artificial intelligence boom. President Trump’s recent executive orders on nuclear power outline a sweeping agenda to quadruple U.S. nuclear capacity by 2050 and prioritize American leadership in nuclear technology globally. The renewed interest in nuclear energy is largely fueled by Big Tech’s push into the sector, as AI data centers require massive amounts of energy. To meet their sustainability goals, many tech giants are increasingly exploring nuclear energy as a solution. Companies like Microsoft MSFT, Amazon AMZN, Google GOOGL, and Meta META are investing heavily in nuclear power projects, including small modular reactor (SMR) development and the revitalization of existing nuclear plants. They are also entering into long-term agreements for nuclear power. Building nuclear power plants is notoriously expensive and time-consuming. That’s why there is growing interest in SMRs, which are typically manufactured in factories and can reduce construction time and costs. When will we start seeing SMRs more widely adopted? Nuclear fusion is often called the ""holy grail"" of energy because it promises a virtually limitless, clean, and safe source of power by replicating the process that fuels the stars. However, no one has yet made fusion power commercially viable. The Range Nuclear Renaissance Index ETF NUKZ holds companies in the nuclear fuel and energy industry. Cameco CCJ, Constellation Energy Corporation CEG, and Oklo OKLO are among its top holdings.

Solana Drops Below $146 Despite Imminent Launch of First U.S.-Based SOL Staking ETF,2025-07-02 05:26:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/solana-drops-below-146-despite-202646557.html,"Solana (SOL) declined 7.84% over the past 24 hours, trading at $145.08 as of 20:03 UTC on July 1, 2025, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model; during the same period, the broader crypto market, as indexed by the CoinDesk 20, went down only 0.24%. SOL's sharp drop comes just one day before a major milestone for the ecosystem: the launch of the REX-Osprey SOL + Staking ETF. Set to debut on July 2, 2025, the REX-Osprey SOL + Staking ETF (ticker: SSK) is the first U.S.-listed exchange-traded fund to provide direct exposure to Solana’s native token while also offering access to staking rewards. Unlike traditional crypto ETFs that only track price, this fund enables holders to passively benefit from Solana’s proof-of-stake reward system. Approximately 80% of the ETF’s assets will be allocated to SOL, with roughly 50% of those tokens actively staked. The fund is structured under the Investment Company Act of 1940, a framework generally viewed as more favorable from a regulatory standpoint than the 1933 Act. The 1940 Act structure may improve investor protections and expedite approvals, which could influence broader institutional participation. Analysts say this launch represents a major step for Solana’s credibility among U.S. financial institutions. By integrating yield generation directly into the ETF, it offers a more comprehensive exposure to the asset than spot-tracking funds. Some market participants believe it could serve as a catalyst for long-term adoption, particularly as other firms including Grayscale, VanEck, and Bitwise pursue similar SOL ETF applications. However, despite the ETF’s pending launch, SOL saw broad-based selling pressure on Monday, underscoring the market’s cautious stance ahead of the event. Technical Analysis Highlights SOL declined $12.34 over the past 24 hours, dropping from $157.42 to $145.08 — a 7.84% loss with a price range of $12.34. Strong resistance was encountered at $157.42 during the first hour of the analysis window, followed by consistent selling pressure throughout the session. The largest volume spike occurred during the 06:00 UTC hour, exceeding 1.57 million units, with price rejection near $151.50. upport emerged at $146.55 during the 14:00 UTC hour, also coinciding with elevated volume, indicating accumulation interest around that level. In the final hour of the analysis window from 19:01 to 20:00 UTC, SOL declined further from $146.31 to $145.08, hitting its lowest price of the day. Price action formed a well-defined descending channel, characterized by lower highs and lower lows across the entire trading period.

US Auto Sales Lose Steam Amid Price Pressure,2025-07-02 04:54:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/us-auto-sales-lose-steam-195444877.html,US auto sales are losing momentum after a springtime surge fueled by shoppers racing to buy cars before President Donald Trump's auto tariffs drove up prices. Bloomberg's Keith Naughton has more on the story.
"Dollar nursing double-digit losses, but bears aren’t done yet: MS",2025-07-02 04:52:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dollar-nursing-double-digit-losses-195248525.html,"Investing.com -- The dollar’s bruising slide to two-year lows this week has some betting on a rebound, but Morgan Stanley warns the bears aren’t ready to loosen their grip just yet. With widely expected U.S. rate cuts later this year and the greenback’s safe-haven status under fresh scrutiny, the bank says more pain could be in store for the dollar.

Fundamentally, a convergence in US growth and interest rates weighs on USD, while increased FX hedging and continued debates around USD’s safe-haven status increase USD’s discount to fair value,” Morgan Stanley strategists said in a recent note. Bets on sooner Federal Reserve rate cuts were given a boost on Tuesday after chairman Jerome Powell didn’t rule out a July rate cut, saying the central bank’s decision would be led by incoming data. Following the remarks from Powell, traders are now pricing in a roughly 23% change of rate in July, up from about 20% a day earlier, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool. While odds still point to no rate cut in July, traders are now closely watching the nonfarm payrolls report due Wednesday for any signs of significant weakness in the labor market that could tip the Fed’s hand into an earlier cut. Technical factors are also amplifying the dollar’s decline. As the incentive for global investors to hedge U.S. assets rises and the cost of FX hedging falls, Morgan Stanley expects hedge ratios for U.S.-held assets—especially European holdings of U.S. equities—to climb, adding further pressure on the greenback. “The more consistent and persistent this positive correlation [between USD and US equities], the greater the incentive to hedge,” the strategists said. Even after this year’s drop in the greenback, dip buyers aren’t likely to emerge as the dollar remains at the upper end of its long-term historical range. The real broad USD index is still about 15% above its long-run average, and above the 90th percentile of its historical range. That, Morgan Stanley says, means the recent selloff isn’t enough to justify a bullish turn: “Citing the extent of year-to-date declines as a reason for hitting pause on USD shorts isn’t a persuasive argument considering the longer-run historical context.” For all the rumblings of a dollar comeback, Morgan Stanley says the bears are still in control. With U.S. rate cuts looming and safe-haven demand fading, the greenback’s slide may have further to run.

"Federal Reserve's Interest Rate Decisions Could Hinge on Tariffs, Chair Powell Says",2025-07-02 04:12:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/federal-reserves-interest-rate-decisions-191205372.html,"Andrew Harnik / Getty Images Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that officials would make decisions on interest rates after closely examining upcoming economic data. Key Takeaways During remarks at a European central bankers conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank would likely have already moved forward with interest rate cuts had President Donald Trump’s tariffs not raised inflation worries. While it hasn’t shown up yet, Powell said officials expect inflation to rise this summer. Powell said Fed officials were making decisions ""meeting by meeting"" based on data. The Federal Reserve is focusing on the possible economic effects of tariffs, as officials say the lingering uncertainty has kept the central bank from cutting its interest rates. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said during a European Central Bank conference on Tuesday that the Fed may have already proceeded with interest rate cuts if not for President Donald Trump's tariffs. “In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs and where essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,” Powell said. “We're simply taking some time. As long as the U.S. economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and learn more and see what those effects might be.” Economists expect inflation to reignite this summer as the current tariffs work their way through the economy. Retailers have reported passing on the additional import tax costs to consumers, and economists suspect this will raise the prices of many goods in the coming months. Powell said the tariffs haven’t yet driven inflation data significantly higher, but that could still be coming. After reducing interest rates in late 2024, the Fed has kept rates at their current levels of 4.25% to 4.5% so far in 2025. The hold has been much to the angst of Trump, who has repeatedly criticized Powell for not cutting interest rates. Some members of the Federal Open Market Committee have said they would consider cutting interest rates as early as the July 30 meeting. While Powell didn’t commit to a specific timeline on interest rate cuts, he said Fed officials would closely watch data to decide “meeting by meeting” when to begin interest rate reductions. “I wouldn't take any meeting off the table or put it directly on the table. It's going to depend on how the data evolves,” Powell said. Read the original article on Investopedia"
Copper Rises to Three-Month High on China Manufacturing Rebound,2025-07-02 04:00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/copper-rises-three-month-high-074114826.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Copper rose to a three-month high, boosted by buying toward the close of trading in China, on signs factory activity is recovering in the world’s second-largest economy. Most Read from Bloomberg Struggling Downtowns Are Looking to Lure New Crowds Sprawl Is Still Not the Answer California Exempts Building Projects From Environmental Law The three-month contract on the London Metal Exchange climbed as much as 1.3% to $10,000 a ton on Tuesday, aligned with gains seen in the final hour of trading in Shanghai. An improvement in Chinese manufacturing last month suggests the top copper consumer is benefiting from a truce in the trade-war with the US. “It has been a China bid which has really spurred the moves today,” said Al Munro, an analyst at Marex Group. “Regardless of any speculation around the state of the macro, the flows and data this desk observes remain positive.” US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg TV on Monday that Washington’s negotiations with Beijing would focus first on reciprocal tariffs, and only “later” on duties on copper and other raw materials. A delayed decision on tariffs would justify a premium on US copper, giving traders a longer window to ship the metal to American warehouses before levies take effect. This could further tighten supplies in other markets. For now, though, there are signs that the worst of a supply squeeze in London is over, with key spreads softening on the LME. The so-called Tom/next spread, which is the cost of rolling a short cash position overnight, has eased significantly after surging last week to the highest since 2021. LME copper settled 0.7% higher at 9,934 a ton in London, while nickel and aluminum were little changed. --With assistance from Charlie Zhu and Winnie Zhu.

Vanguard Plans First Junk ETF as JPMorgan Heats Up Active Race,2025-07-02 02:49:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vanguard-plans-first-junk-etf-174934075.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Vanguard Group is planning its debut into an increasingly competitive corner of the $11.6 trillion US exchange-traded fund arena.

The Vanguard High-Yield Active ETF would trade under the ticker VGHY and invest at least 80% of its portfolio in high-yield debt, according to a Tuesday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The fund’s proposed fee is 0.22% — cheaper than any existing actively managed high-yield ETFs, data compiled by Bloomberg showed. VGHY looks set to mark Vanguard’s first foray into the junk-bond ETF universe. The Jack Bogle-founded firm, which oversees more than $10 trillion globally, has zeroed in on active fixed-income as an avenue for growth. But it faces stiff competition: just last week, JPMorgan Asset Management — which ranks as the fastest-growing asset manager — launched its first active high-yield ETF with a $2 billion investment from a mystery anchor. While VGHY’s proposed fee is half that of the JPMorgan fund’s 0.45% expense ratio, that likely won’t be a huge differentiating factor, according to Bloomberg Intelligence’s Eric Balchunas, who is also the author of The Bogle Effect. “JPMorgan is so on fire lately with their active funds that even Vanguard is on notice,” he said. “Their low fee will have less impact than in old days. The Vanguard Effect has actually spread faster than Vanguard itself in many cases now.” In addition to JPMorgan Asset Management, Capital Group also unveiled its first actively managed high-yield ETF last week. Junk-bond ETFs have attracted roughly $11.6 billion so far this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, with inflows accelerating over the past two months as corporate earnings stayed resilient despite uncertainty over tariffs. Vanguard, long known for its index-tracking funds, has launched at least two actively managed ETFs so far this year, bringing its total stable to 12 funds. Assets in active ETFs now account about 10% of the overall industry, compared to less than 5% a decade ago, Bloomberg Intelligence data show. “You know the active movement is big when Vanguard is launching more funds in the space than they have in what feels like ages,” said Todd Sohn, senior ETF analyst at Strategas Research. “Active is 10% of ETF assets now — lots of room to grow.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek SNAP Cuts in Big Tax Bill Will Hit a Lot of Trump Voters Too How to Steal a House America’s Top Consumer-Sentiment Economist Is Worried China’s Homegrown Jewelry Superstar Pistachios Are Everywhere Right Now, Not Just in Dubai Chocolate ©2025 Bloomberg L.P."
Why LVMH Stock Was Climbing Today,2025-07-02 02:48:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-lvmh-stock-climbing-today-174849770.html,"Key Points Goldman Sachs called LVMH a ""conviction buy."" LVMH has been struggling due to the weak economy in China and uncertainty around the trade situation. 10 stocks we like better than LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton › Shares of LVMH (OTC: LVMUY) were moving higher today as the luxury goods conglomerate won an endorsement from Goldman Sachs . As of 12:10 p.m. ET, the stock was up 5.1% on the news. Image source: Getty Images. LVMH gets a leg up Luxury stocks have struggled in the current environment amid weak consumer spending in China and pressure from the trade war, but now one of Wall Street's most respected institutions thinks the sell-off has gone too far. This morning, Goldman added LVMH to its European Conviction Buy list, arguing that investors should look through second-quarter softness and calling LVMH ""a clear winner in the next luxury upcycle."" LVMH's first-quarter revenue results were disappointing as organic revenue was down 3% to 20.3 billion euros. Additionally, the company didn't post organic growth in any of its five categories, and fashion and leather goods, its biggest segment, saw a 5% decline in organic revenue. What's next for LVMH The luxury goods sector is sensitive to the same set of economic factors, including spending in China, the general economic cycle, and the stock market. However, luxury goods like LVMH's wide range of brands are also known for timelessness, and the company has a long history of riding out economic volatility and continuing to grow. While Goldman Sachs might be premature in the timing of its call, given the highly fluid trade situation, the stock looks well priced at a price-to-earnings valuation of 19. With the stock down by nearly a third over the past year, LVMH should eventually bounce back, and that could come sooner rather than later if the global economy can absorb the trade shifts.

Financials ETF (IYF) Hits New 52-Week High,2025-07-02 02:48:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/financials-etf-iyf-hits-52-174800309.html,"US Financials Ishares ETF IYF is probably on the radar for investors seeking momentum. The fund just hit a 52-week high and moved up 30.49% from its 52-week low price of $92.83/share. Are more gains in store for this ETF? Let us take a quick look at the fund and the near-term outlook on it to get a better idea of where it might be headed. IYF in Focus The Russell 1000 Financials 40 Act 15/22.5 Daily Capped Index measures the performance of the financial sector of the U.S. equity market. The product charges 39 bps in annual fees (see: all Financials ETFs). Why the Move? The financial sector has been an area to watch lately, given the likelihood of the Fed cutting interest rates, along with signs of regulatory easing. The Fed may be on track to ease interest rates sooner than expected, potentially lowering the capital costs for banks. U.S. regulators have proposed major rollbacks of bank capital rules since the 2008 financial crisis. The proposal targets the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio (eSLR), which requires the largest U.S. banks to hold additional capital, based solely on their size. The proposed change is expected to have a broadly positive impact on major U.S. lenders. More Gains Ahead? Currently, IYF has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) and a Medium risk outlook. However, it might continue its strong performance in the near term, with a positive weighted alpha of 25.46 (as per Barchart.com), which gives cues of a further rally.

Navigating Market Risks in the Second Half of 2025: ETFs to Consider,2025-07-02 02:43:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/navigating-market-risks-second-half-174300619.html,"After sliding nearly 19% between mid-February and early April, the U.S. economy reversed course, rebounding about 24% since early April. While many economists expect the U.S. market bulls to continue with their momentum going into the second half of the year, underlying risk factors still remain, making it prudent for investors to increase exposure to defensive funds. According to Goldman Sachs, as quoted on CNBC, mounting policy risks and macro conditions are set to keep equity markets on edge. Below, we mention a few factors that contribute to market uncertainty and weigh on investor sentiment, setting the stage for an uncertain second half of 2025. Tariffs Add Fuel to Investor Uncertainty Inflationary pressures, intensified by the tariffs proposed by President Donald Trump, continue to be a major headwind for the U.S. economy. According to Greg Daco, chief economist at EY, tariff-driven inflation could reaccelerate inflation, leading to income erosion and a potential slowdown in consumer spending, as quoted on Yahoo Finance. Invest in Gold Priority Gold: Up to $15k in Free Silver + Zero Account Fees on Qualifying Purchase Learn More American Hartford Gold: #1 Precious Metals Dealer in the Nation Learn More Thor Metals Group: Best Overall Gold IRA Learn More Powered by Money.com - Yahoo may earn commission from the links above. Per analysts at JPMorgan, as quoted on Reuters, expectations of tariff-driven stagflation have been a key factor behind their downward revision of GDP forecasts to 1.3% in 2025, down from their previous estimate of 2%. Stagflation is an economic condition marked by the combination of slowing growth, rising inflation and high unemployment, occurring simultaneously. The unpredictability of the Trump administration’s tariff policy was highlighted last Friday, when the President called off trade talks with Canada, moments after confirming a deal with China, testing investor confidence. Volatility Ranging From Geopolitics to Recession JPMorgan analysts continue to see a heightened risk of a recession, forecasting a 40% likelihood of a recession in the second half of the year. While the ceasefire between Israel and Iran was seen as a positive step toward stability in the Middle East, underlying geopolitical tensions persist, and market sentiment remains fragile. Persistent uncertainty surrounding Iran’s nuclear ambitions and renewed escalation in the Russia-Ukraine war, with Russia recently launching its most extensive aerial attack since the conflict began, put a strain on market expectations and kept geopolitical risk structurally high. Fed Uncertainty and Mounting Debt Pressure Concerns over U.S. debt levels, coupled with leadership and political uncertainty of the Fed, add pressure to investor confidence. The $4.2 trillion tax-cut proposal from Trump, alongside elevated spending plans, is projected to significantly expand federal debt. An increasing number of investors had been anticipating a Fed rate cut in July. However, with the central bank maintaining a cautious tone, a September cut now appears far more likely. Per the CME FedWatch tool, markets are anticipating a 93.2% likelihood of a rate cut in September compared to a 78.8% likelihood of the rates remaining unchanged in July. According to Reuters, President Trump’s comments about Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, hinting at a possible Fed leadership shake-up, remain a significant source of investor unease. Labor Market Frictions Immigration bottlenecks and aging demographics threaten to slow labor force growth and add another layer of uncertainty to the economic outlook. According to economists at Barclays, as quoted on Reuters, the combined impact of both is expected to create significant and lasting headwinds to labor force growth and overall economic activity. Barclays economists estimate that potential job growth could decline to around 60,000 per month over the next six months, dragging economic growth down to 1.4-1.6% through next year, from the current 2%. ETFs to Explore Institutional investor sentiment remains subdued, with investors remain broadly cautious despite the markets rebounding. In such an economic environment, preserving capital and cushioning volatility is key for investors. Investors should adopt a defensive approach as it's better to be cautious than unprepared. With ETFs offering the additional benefit of instant diversification and tax efficiency, investors can use ETFs to increase exposure to defensive funds. Investing in these sectors not only shields portfolios from downside risks and safeguards investments during market distress but also offers gains when the broader market trends upward. These sectors provide dual benefits, protecting portfolios during market downturns and offering gains when the market rises. Value ETFs Vanguard Value ETF VTV, iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF IWD and iShares S&P 500 Value ETF IVE, having a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), could be appealing options. Characterized by solid fundamentals, such as earnings, dividends, book value and cash flow, these stocks trade below their intrinsic value, representing undervaluation. Gold ETFs Investors can also consider funds, such as SPDR Gold Shares GLD, iShares Gold Trust IAU and SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust GLDM, increasing exposure to the yellow metal. Across extended investment periods, gold preserves its purchasing power, outpacing inflation. Additionally, a safe-haven investment during a challenging period, gold remains a secure choice amid economic and geopolitical instability. Quality ETFs Investors can look at funds like iShares MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF QUAL, Invesco S&P 500 Quality ETF SPHQ and JPMorgan U.S. Quality Factor ETF JQUA. Amid market uncertainty, quality investing emerges as a strategic response, providing a potential buffer against the potential headwinds. Investment Strategies to Follow In addition to the funds mentioned, investors can also implement investment strategies, such as buy-and-hold and dollar-cost averaging (DCA). Both stand out as effective strategies to create portfolio momentum and build wealth in the long term, ignoring short-term price fluctuations. The investment strategies remove emotional behavior from investing, preventing investors from overtrading and making impulsive decisions like panic selling during downturns or overbuying in a rally, which can harm their portfolio. This is especially relevant in the current economic landscape. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Here's How Much Traders Expect Tesla Stock to Move After Deliveries Data Due Wednesday,2025-07-02 02:17:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-much-traders-expect-tesla-171740386.html,"Tim Goessman / Bloomberg / Getty Images Tesla stock has lost about one-quarter of its value since the start of the year Tesla ( TSLA ) is expected to report production and deliveries figures for the second quarter on Wednesday morning, with investors anticipating a sizable move after a losing streak for the stock. Shares dropped nearly 5% to just over $303 in recent trading, amid worries about an escalation in the feud between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump over the president's signature "" One Big Beautiful Bill ."" Current options pricing suggests traders see shares moving about another 5% in either direction by the end of the week following the data's release. That would leave the stock near $318 at the high end, and just below $290 at the low end by the end of Thursday's session, with markets closed on Friday for Independence Day . After last quarter's deliveries disappointed, shares sank shortly after the data was released, but ended the day up 5%. Still, they tumbled in the following days as markets were battered by President Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcement . After the release of delivery figures in January and last October , Tesla shares fell 6% and 3.4%, respectively. The EV maker's stock rallied to a record high in December following Trump's election win, but have lost about one-quarter of their value in 2025 so far as Musk's political activities made Tesla the subject of protests and sales tumbled in key markets. Shares rebounded as Musk left the administration and Tesla recently launched its robotaxi service , but stumbled again as Musk and Trump traded barbs on social media. Tomorrow, Tesla is expected to report a 10% year-over-year drop in quarterly deliveries to about 394,000 vehicles, and production of 434,200. Analysts from JPMorgan, William Blair, and Deutsche Bank warned clients they expect Tesla could miss delivery estimates as demand remains weak and competition grows. JPMorgan analysts wrote they ""see material risk to the outlook for full year deliveries also, given that consensus requires a sharp pivot from underperformance to outperformance of expected seasonal pattern despite the likely significant near-term curtailment of EV subsidies."" The EV maker's stock has divided analysts, with 10 of those surveyed by Visible Alpha issuing ""buy"" or equivalent ratings, with four ""hold"" and four ""sell"" ratings. Their average price target near $306 would suggest less than 1% upside from Tuesday's intraday level. Read the original article on Investopedia"
3 High-Yielding Dividend Stocks That Are Trading Near Their 52-Week Lows,2025-07-02 02:14:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-high-yielding-dividend-stocks-171400706.html,"Key Points The stocks listed here pay between 2.2% and 4.8% in dividends. They have all been increasing their payouts for decades. With strong underlying businesses, investors can feel safe hanging on to these stocks for the long haul. 10 stocks we like better than Lowe's Companies › When a stock is trading near its 52-week low, that can potentially be an attractive time to buy. A cheaper share price means that investors aren't feeling great about the stock for one reason or another. In some cases, it may be an overreaction, but in other cases, there is significant risk and the sharp drop in price is justifiable. For the three stocks listed here, there isn't much risk. They aren't doing well this year, but they still have great businesses, and they can recover in the long run. Lowe's Companies (NYSE: LOW) , Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) , and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) all offer attractive yields that are higher than the S&P 500 average of 1.2%. Here's why these can be terrific stocks to add to your portfolio today, especially if you want a lot of dividend income . Image source: Getty Images. Lowe's Companies: 2.2% yield Home improvement retailer Lowe's has seen its share price fall by more than 9% since the start of the year (returns as of June 27). It's getting close to its 52-week low of $206.39. Investors are worried that amid sluggish economic conditions, people are going to be holding back on spending on home renovation projects and repairs, which is a valid concern. But it's also a short-term one. As economic conditions improve, there should be an uptick in business for Lowe's. For the current fiscal year (which ends in January), Lowe's is projecting its comparable sales to be flat to up 1%. While that doesn't scream growth, it also means the company isn't expecting its revenue to nosedive, either. It's stable, and that's a good sign for dividend investors. If the business can keep things relatively stable amid such challenging macroeconomic conditions, that's a good sign of its overall strength and diversification. The company's payout ratio is also modest at just 38%, which means the dividend is well supported with solid financials. Although this may not be a terribly exciting stock to own right now, Lowe's can make for a great long-term buy. It trades at less than 19 times its trailing earnings, and with an above-average yield of 2.2%, it can be a good option to consider adding to your portfolio. The company has also increased its dividend for more than 50 consecutive years, making it a Dividend King. Procter & Gamble: 2.6% yield You can collect a higher yield with Procter & Gamble stock, where the payout is around 2.6%. Entering trading this week, the stock was just a few dollars away from its 52-week low of $156.58. However, it's down around 5% since the start of the year. The sell-off hasn't been extreme, but it's been enough to push this blue chip stock near its low. During the first three months of the year, the company's net sales totaled $19.8 billion and were down 2% year over year. However, its organic growth rate, which excludes the effects of foreign currency, divestitures, and acquisitions, was steady at 1%. As with Lowe's, this isn't an exciting rate of growth for the business. But Procter & Gamble's business has generally been fairly stable over the years. The company has many top consumer brands in its portfolio, including Pampers and Tide. These are staples that people simply can't do without. The biggest risk is that consumers might trade down to no-name products, but there hasn't been a significant drop in sales lately to suggest that that's a huge concern for the business. The stock remains a solid investment over the long term, especially when you consider that it has raised its payout for 69 consecutive years. While you'll be collecting 2.6% in dividends if you invest today, over the long term, that dividend income is likely to rise. This is another example of a great stock to just buy and hold for years. Chevron: 4.8% yield The highest payout on this list belongs to oil and gas giant Chevron, which yields 4.8%. This Warren Buffett-approved stock is down around 1% this year, which doesn't look too bad given that oil prices have been falling over the past 12 months. There can be considerable volatility that comes with the stock due to changing commodity prices. In its most recent quarter, which ended on March 31, Chevron's net income declined by 37% to $3.5 billion. While that may seem troubling, that can also easily change if the price of oil rises higher in the future. What's impressive is that even despite the volatility, the company has a dividend growth streak that spans 38 years. Even with the drop in earnings, its payout ratio is still around 75%. As a leading company and producer in the oil and gas industry, Chevron can be a fairly stable and safe investment to hang on to, especially if you love dividends. While it has been rallying over the past month, it's still not far from its 52-week low of $132.04. Now can be a great time to buy it. Should you invest $1,000 in Lowe's Companies right now?

Will AGNC Investment's Exposure to Agency MBS Drive Growth?,2025-07-02 02:13:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/agnc-investments-exposure-agency-mbs-171300666.html,"AGNC Investment AGNC has maintained its focus on agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), which remain the core of its portfolio strategy. As of March 31, 2025, AGNC held $70.5 billion in Agency MBS within a total investment portfolio of $78.9 billion. The government-sponsored enterprise guarantee for the principal and interest payments makes Agency MBS a safer investment choice. The fundamental outlook for fixed income, particularly agency MBS assets, has shown signs of improvement lately. However, following the April tariff announcement, financial market volatility increased substantially, and Agency MBS spreads to benchmark rates widened. Nonetheless, with its conservative leverage profile and ample liquidity, AGNC Investment is well-positioned for this instability. As of March 31, 2025, AGNC had $6 billion in cash and unencumbered Agency MBS, offering flexibility to manage funding and reinvestment. Moreover, management believes that Agency MBS offers investors a compelling return opportunity for AGNC. Although the market is extremely competitive, the company's focus on agency MBS puts it in a position to possibly profit from favorable trends. However, execution will be crucial to achieving these advantages. How AGNC Competes With NLY & STWD AGNC competes with Annaly Capital Management NLY and Starwood Property Trust STWD within the mortgage REITs space. Annaly’s investment strategy is significantly based on traditional Agency MBS. As of March 31, 2025, the company’s investment portfolio totaled $84.9 billion, of which $75 billion was allocated to Agency MBS. Most of these securities held actual or implied AAA ratings. Management remains optimistic about the 2025 outlook for Agency MBS, driven by favorable dynamics. Further, Annaly’s Agency MBS holdings are anticipated to provide stronger returns, supported by favorable supply-demand dynamics, lower financing costs, and a steeper yield curve. In contrast, Starwood Property Trust focuses on commercial real estate-backed investments. It emphasizes commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) and related commercial real estate assets. As of the first quarter of 2025, the company held a $1.02 billion CMBS portfolio. Despite a slight decline in CMBS holdings during the first quarter of 2025, the company’s income remained steady through principal repayments and targeted acquisitions. However, Starwood Property Trust’s asset management expertise and ability to navigate the complexities of the CMBS market contribute to its strong market position and growth potential in the future. AGNC Investment's Price Performance, Valuations & Estimates Over the past year, shares of AGNC have lost 1.7% compared with the industry’s decline of 4.1%. One Year Price Performance Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research From a valuation standpoint, AGNC Investment trades at a forward price-to-tangible book (P/TB) ratio of 1.08X, above the industry’s average of 0.97X. Price-to-Tangible Book TTM Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AGNC’s 2025 and 2026 earnings implies year-over-year declines of 11.2% and 3.9%, respectively.

YouTube Provides More Tools to Help Grow Your Channel Audience,2025-07-02 02:07:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/youtube-provides-more-tools-help-170712576.html,"This story was originally published on Social Media Today . To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Social Media Today newsletter . YouTube’s looking to provide channel managers with m ore tools to help grow their in-app communities , including updated audience engagement insights, and improved markers of interaction opportunities in-stream. First off, YouTube’s giving channel managers more insights into audience engagement, including expanded data on “New” and “Returning” viewers. As you can see in this example, YouTube will now give you more specific data on viewer behavior, with updated categorization of each video’s audience. As per YouTube : “We're introducing deeper audience insights to help creators understand their viewers beyond just ‘New’ and ‘Returning.’ Creators will now be able to see granular segmentation based on long-term viewer behavior, including ‘New’, ‘Casual,’ and ‘Regular’ viewers. The goal is to help creators build better content strategies and grow their audience.” Essentially, the “Returning” viewers metric is being replaced with more detailed categories, including “Casual” and “Regular” viewers. “Casual viewers are those who've been watching occasionally for a while, specifically between one and five months in the last year. Regular viewers are those who've been watching more consistently, specifically for six or more months in the last twelve months.” The additional categories will provide more insight into viewer engagement trends, and help you get a better understanding of audience behaviors, and your broader community-building efforts. So if you’re looking to build your YouTube community, and boost those “Regular” viewer stats, you’ll now have more data to refer to when strategizing your output with that goal in mind. On that front, YouTube recommends that channel managers utilize community-building options, like Community Posts , to further engage your audience. YouTube says that posts, as well as responding to viewer comments, can help to enhance connection, while exclusive events, including live-streams, can further enhance those efforts. However you choose to go about it, these updated data points will provide more insight for you to build your strategy around, and ensure that you’re boosting the right metrics for your goals. YouTube says that its updated audience insights are being rolled out to all creators globally from today. YouTube’s also expanding access to its “Most relevant” comment filter, which highlights key engagement opportunities in the app. As you can see in this example, using the “Most relevant” filter, creators will be able to quickly find key opportunities, like questions from viewers. YouTube originally announced the option late last year , and it’s now expanding access to all creators, providing another community-building opportunity. YouTube’s also expanding access to its live-stream leaderboard, which displays the most engaged viewers on each live-stream (which it began testing earlier this month ), while YouTube Premium members in the U.S. can now access the platform’s latest AI discovery elements , which provide additional, auto-generated context on certain queries. “When a premium user searches for queries related to shopping, places, or things to do in a specific location, the carousel will populate relevant videos with brief topic descriptions on the results page. The goal is to help users quickly discover videos and topics related to their query, and provides a new way for creators to be discovered by viewers who might not have found them otherwise.” Both of these features were announced recently, but are now being expanded to more users. Some handy updates, primarily focused on growing your YouTube audience, and maximizing connection with your viewers.

Is Palantir Technologies a Buy?,2025-07-02 02:05:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/palantir-technologies-buy-170500077.html,"Key Points Palantir stock has advanced 73% year to date after a 341% rally last year. Owning Palantir shares comes with risk, as its stock is very expensive. However, investors should focus on the company's long-term potential -- not its short-term volatility. 10 stocks we like better than Palantir Technologies › Invest in Gold Thor Metals Group: Best Overall Gold IRA Learn More Priority Gold: Up to $15k in Free Silver + Zero Account Fees on Qualifying Purchase Learn More American Hartford Gold: #1 Precious Metals Dealer in the Nation Learn More Powered by Money.com - Yahoo may earn commission from the links above. Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) stock cannot be stopped. At least, that's the way things look at the halfway mark of 2025. As of this writing, Palantir shares have advanced 73% year to date. That's on top of a 341% rally last year. The only question is: Can this incredible run continue? To get to the bottom of that, let's examine why Palantir has been one of the top beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Image source: Getty Images. What's the bull case for Palantir stock? Let's begin by looking at the bull case for Palantir. First: Palantir continues to land key government contracts. The company has long-standing partnerships with American and European government agencies, both military and civilia n. In the U.S., Palantir counts among its partners the Department of Defense, the U.S. Intelligence Community, the Health and Human Services (HHS) department , Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Moreover, in some cases, Palantir is tasked with mission-critical objectives that could include highly sensitive or classified information. As geopolitical tensions increase and the AI arms race between the U.S. and China intensifies, Palantir could benefit as American lawmakers pour further government resources into AI. Turning to fundamentals, Palantir's strong revenue growth of 39% and a significant backlog of $1.9 billion of remaining performance obligations (RPO) point to the company's continued strength. In addition, while exact estimates vary, Palantir's total addressable market (TAM) could grow to over $1 trillion within the next decade , which would provide even more opportunities for Palantir within the governmental and private sectors. What are the risks for Palantir stock? So what about the downside risks? First off, there's Palantir's current valuation. With a sky-high price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 113x, there's little room for error. If the company misses estimates for sales, earnings, or client growth, its stock price could plummet. PLTR PS Ratio data by YCharts Second, Palantir's bevy of government contracts aren't just a benefit; they're also a risk. If government spending were to contract or if Palantir were to fall out of favor, its high concentration of government work could drag down its overall growth rate. Similarly, some lawmakers have raised privacy concerns related to Palantir's f ederal government work . Palantir issued a strong rebuttal, denying reports that it was building a ""master database"" and noting its 20-year history of working with administrations of both political parties. Nevertheless, Palantir's close ties to government agencies could invite future blowback. Next, there is dilution risk. In short, Palantir pays out a lot of stock-based compensation -- over $720 million worth over the last 12 months. That dilutes existing shareholders. In fact, over the last 12 months, Palantir's shares outstanding have increased by 5%. So far, the dilution hasn't slowed down Palantir's skyrocketing stock price, but it could at some point in the future . PLTR Shares Outstanding data by YCharts Finally, there's the ever-present risk of a downturn in the economy or the stock market. In particular, if sentiment were to turn bearish, Palantir's stock could fall rapidly, as its valuation is very high. Is Palantir stock a buy right now? While the risks to owning Palantir stock are real, the bull case is more persuasive to me. Therefore, the real question investors should ask themselves when it comes to Palantir stock is whether they have the conviction to hold it for the long term. Shares are expensive; they are likely to experience drastic sell-offs. However, Palantir's enormous TAM points to its massive potential. Given the stock's risks and likelihood of a pullback, long-term investors would be wise to buy shares on the dip, or perhaps dollar-cost average into a position. In other words, Palantir shares are to be owned -- not traded. Should you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?

Job Openings Rise Again in May As Trade Tensions Cool,2025-07-02 01:52:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/job-openings-rise-again-may-165219486.html,"Photographer: Adam Gray/Bloomberg via Getty Images The demand for workers is still strong, according to the latest data. Key Takeaways Job openings increased to 7.8 million in May, marking the second straight month that employers have sought to expand their payrolls. The rise surprised economists, who have been watching for any impact from President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. Employers may be moving beyond uncertainty and hiring anyway, economists said, especially as trade tensions with China cooled. The job market continued to surprise forecasters, as new data for May showed employers again added more job openings and laid off fewer workers.  After several months of uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump’s tariffs , employers may be tired of waiting and are moving to add to payrolls. Job openings increased for a second straight month in May to reach 7.8 million, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires expected the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) to register a slight decline from the April report , which found employers had 7.4 million open positions. Additionally, employers reported fewer layoffs in May, though hiring also slowed slightly. Economists have been watching for a slowdown in the labor market, pointing to continuing jobless claims and other recent data that indicates a weakening employment landscape. They are also looking for signs that tariffs are having an impact, but so far, the labor market is holding up. Employment data for June is set to be released Thursday. “Without a clear picture of what may happen if and when the current tariff pause ends, employers may just be making decisions based on what they see today rather than trying to anticipate what happens tomorrow,” said Indeed Hiring Lab economist Allison Shrivastava. The data also showed that cooling trade tensions with China in May helped employers with their hiring decisions, especially in industries like transportation, warehousing and manufacturing that are more directly impacted by tariffs. “The trade détente helped reinvigorate small business confidence over the month and may have contributed to the better-than-expected increase in job openings,” wrote Wells Fargo economists Sarah House and Nicole Cervi.

Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this company that makes products ranging from street sweepers to toll booth technology for government, industrial and commercial customers is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below: Earnings Growth Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration. While the historical EPS growth rate for Federal Signal is 17.8%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 14.7% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 5.4%. Cash Flow Growth While cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds. Right now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Federal Signal is 24.6%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -9.5%. While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 12.2% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 4.6%. Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions Beyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Federal Signal. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.1% over the past month.

While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this specialty contractor for utility and energy companies is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below: Earnings Growth Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration. While the historical EPS growth rate for Quanta Services is 23.2%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 15.2% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 13.9%. Cash Flow Growth Cash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds. Right now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Quanta Services is 24.6%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 14.4%. While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 21.9% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 6.2%. Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Quanta Services. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.1% over the past month. Bottom Line Quanta Services has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. This combination positions Quanta Services well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.

Gold Rises With Trump’s Tax Bill Seen Widening US Deficits,2025-07-02 01:44:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-edges-higher-us-rate-004652130.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Gold rose for a second day as investors weigh President Donald Trump’s tax bill, which is expected to further expand US deficits. Most Read from Bloomberg Struggling Downtowns Are Looking to Lure New Crowds Sprawl Is Still Not the Answer California Exempts Building Projects From Environmental Law Bullion gained as much as 1.7%, further paring its losses in the past two weeks, while US stocks edged lower and the dollar was near three-year lows. The US Senate passed the bill that combines $4.5 trillion in tax cuts with $1.2 trillion in spending reductions. The US government pushing through the spending bill means that “fiscal risks are likely to come to the fore,” analysts at Commerzbank AG said in a note, potentially benefitting gold’s haven asset appeal. Gold’s gains eased slightly after US jobs data came in hotter than expected, reducing the outlook for monetary easing that tends to benefit the non-interest bearing precious metal. The S&P 500 dipped after a rally that drove stocks to successive all-time highs. Gold is up by more than a quarter this year, trading about $160 short of April’s record, supported by elevated trade and geopolitical risks. Uncertainty over the long-term impact of Trump’s tariff and fiscal agendas on the economy saw a gauge of the dollar drop almost 11% in the first six months of year, the worst performance since 1973. That makes gold cheaper for buyers in most other currencies. “Gold, despite its recent losses, has the most potential to gain in the short term if the US dollar continues to decline,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia analyst Vivek Dhar said in a note. Spot gold was up 1.2% to $3,342.65 an ounce at 12:40 p.m. in New York. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was flat, after falling 0.5% Monday. --With assistance from Sybilla Gross.

Trump’s Tax Bill Passes US Senate as Republicans Notch Major Win,2025-07-02 01:36:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-tax-bill-passes-us-161348768.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Donald Trump’s $3.3 trillion tax and spending cut bill passed the Senate Tuesday after a furious push by Republican leaders to persuade holdouts to back the legislation and hand the president a political win. Most Read from Bloomberg Struggling Downtowns Are Looking to Lure New Crowds Sprawl Is Still Not the Answer California Exempts Building Projects From Environmental Law Senators voted 51-50 to pass the bill, with three Republicans — Susan Collins of Maine, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Rand Paul of Kentucky, defying Trump to oppose the legislation. Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote. The package, which now goes to the House, combines $4.5 trillion in tax cuts with $1.2 trillion in spending cuts. “This was a team effort,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters immediately following the vote on Tuesday. “In the end, we got the job done.” The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index climbed to a session high after the bill passed the Senate. It was falling for six months through the end of June. The package — informally known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill” — includes the entirety of the president’s legislative agenda in a single package. Trump personally lobbied lawmakers to quickly move the legislation through Congress. “It’s a great bill. There is something for everyone,” Trump told reporters on Tuesday. “And I think it’s going to go very nicely in the House. Actually, I think it will be easier in the House than it was in the Senate.” Republicans say passing the bill will help them maintain their congressional majorities in the midterms. But polling suggests the bill is not particularly popular. A recent Pew Research survey found that 49% of Americans oppose the bill, while 29% supported it. Some 21% weren’t sure what to think. “This vote will haunt our Republican colleagues for years to come,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on Tuesday. “People will get sick and die, kids will go hungry and the debt will explode to levels that we have never seen.” House Action The House is expected to vote on the bill this week, but success is not guaranteed. Only a few Republicans can vote “no” in the House for the bill to pass in the face of united Democratic opposition. Speaker Mike Johnson said the House “will work quickly” to pass the bill by July 4. Conservatives there say they are still pushing for more spending cuts while moderates have expressed alarm at the Senate bill’s reductions to Medicaid and other social safety net programs. Senator Lisa Murkowski, a GOP holdout who ultimately supported the bill, said she hopes the House makes changes to the bill that prompt further negotiations. The Alaska Republican, who was at the center of GOP leader’s push for votes, has raised concerns about Medicaid and clean energy cuts. “More process is needed,” Murkowski said after the Senate vote. It’s unclear whether the Senate bill can make it through the narrow Republican majority in the House, which passed its own version of Trump’s tax bill by a single vote. The Senate bill would raise the state and local tax deduction from $10,000 to $40,000 for just five years, sparking opposition from one New York Republican who views it as inadequate. Meanwhile, cuts to hospital payments have moved others to declare their opposition. Any changes in the House would force the Senate to take up the bill again, scuttling Trump’s plans to sign the bill by July 4. Trump Agenda Republicans have said the legislation will boost the economy, curb illegal immigration and start the process of cutting waste in Medicaid and other entitlement programs. The tax cut bill would avoid a large tax increase for individuals at the start of next year when the 2017 Trump tax cuts expire and it would permanently extend some partly expired business tax breaks, which the president has said would contribute to economic growth. Many economists, however, have warned that the bill provides little economic boost and exacerbates the country’s fiscal woes. The “US fiscal path is not a sustainable one,” Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell said Tuesday. “The level of the debt is sustainable but the path is not, and we need to address that sooner or later. Sooner is better than later.” At Trump’s request, the bill adds new tax breaks for tips, car loans and overtime work and expands tax breaks for seniors and parents that he popularized on the campaign trail. These new tax breaks are funded by deep cuts to the renewable energy sector, a move that will ultimately benefit the fossil fuel industry. The popular electric vehicle tax credit would be axed, something that sparked outrage from Trump’s one-time staunch ally Elon Musk, whose Tesla Inc. would suffer. The bill would send hundreds of billions in new funds to the military, solidifying Trump’s emphasis on hard power over foreign aid, which he has slashed. It also would boost funding for immigration enforcement. Safety-Net Programs These costly tax cuts and spending increases are partly paid for by spending cuts primarily targeted at Medicaid, food stamps and federal student loans. Democrats say the cuts to anti-poverty programs combined with the tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy make the bill highly regressive. They also point out the $3.3 trillion increase in deficits over ten years despite GOP claims of fiscal responsibility. Nearly $1 trillion would be cut from Medicaid by imposing a new work requirement for able-bodied adults without children, imposing co-pays and limiting federal reimbursements to states. Food stamp work requirements would expand and states with error-prone systems would be penalized. The Congressional Budget Office estimates 11.8 million people could lose health coverage over the course of a decade as a result of the bill. The legislation would avoid a US payment default as soon as August by raising the debt limit by $5 trillion. Trump and Republicans argued that using the partisan budget reconciliation process to raise the limit without Democrats allows the GOP to avoid making any concessions to the minority party, such as increased spending on domestic programs. Senators during the final negotiations voted to kill a controversial effort to prevent US states from regulating artificial intelligence, marking a loss major technology companies including Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc., as well as venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz, that pushed the measure to stave state-level rules. --With assistance from Jamie Tarabay, Jennifer A.

Four Reasons to Add SBA Communications Stock to Your Portfolio,2025-07-02 01:24:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/four-reasons-add-sba-communications-162400513.html,"SBA Communications ' SBAC portfolio is well-positioned to gain from wireless carriers’ high capital spending for network expansion amid growth in mobile data usage. The long-term leases with its tenants assure stable revenues. Also, portfolio expansion moves, domestically and internationally, are encouraging. Invest in Gold American Hartford Gold: #1 Precious Metals Dealer in the Nation Learn More Priority Gold: Up to $15k in Free Silver + Zero Account Fees on Qualifying Purchase Learn More Thor Metals Group: Best Overall Gold IRA Learn More Powered by Money.com - Yahoo may earn commission from the links above. Analysts seem positive about this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SBAC’s 2025 and 2026 funds from operations (FFO) per share has moved marginally northward over the past two months to $12.74 and $13.09, respectively. In the past six months, shares of this communications real estate investment trust (REIT) company have gained 18.3% compared with the industry's upside of 6.5%. Given its solid fundamentals and positive estimate revisions, the stock is likely to keep performing well in the quarters ahead. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Factors That Make SBA Communications Stock a Solid Pick Robust Market Demand: The advancement in mobile technology, such as 4G and 5G networks, and the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications have propelled growth in mobile data usage globally. With increasing smartphone adoption, greater broadband demand and plans for 5G service worldwide, wireless service providers and carriers have been deploying additional equipment for existing networks to enhance network coverage and capacity. This has been spurring the demand for SBA Communications’ wireless communications infrastructure. Resilient Business Model: SBA Communications has a resilient and stable site-leasing business model. The company generates most of its revenues from long-term tower leases that have built-in rent escalators. With high operating margins, its tower-leasing business remains attractive. Wireless service providers continue to lease additional antenna space on the company’s towers amid the increase in network use, data transfer, network expansion and network coverage requirements. During 2025, management expects core leasing revenues in both its domestic and international segments to increase over 2024 levels on a currency-neutral basis. This is due in part to wireless carriers deploying unused spectrum, and revenues from towers acquired and built during 2024 and expected to be acquired and built during 2025. Expansion Efforts: As the company continues to expand its tower portfolio and seek new growth opportunities, it focuses on business expansion into domestic and select international markets with high growth characteristics. In the first quarter of 2025, SBAC acquired 344 communication sites, including Milicom’s 321 sites and built 67 towers. Additionally, SBA Communications spent $8 million to purchase land and easements and extend lease terms during the first quarter of 2025. As of April 28, 2025, along with around Millicom’s 6,700 sites under contract for $925 million in cash, SBA Communications is under contract to buy 18 communication sites for a total consideration of $10 million in cash, which is expected to close by the end of the third quarter. Such portfolio expansion efforts will position SBA Communications to leverage secular trends in mobile data usage and wireless spending growth across the globe. Solid Dividend Payment: Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT shareholders, and SBA Communications remains committed to that. In February 2025, the REIT announced a quarterly cash dividend of $1.11 per share on its Class A common stock, indicating an increase of nearly 13% from the prior quarter. The company has increased its dividend five times in the last five years, and its five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 19.97%. Given SBAC’s solid operating platform and decent financial position, the dividend distribution is expected to be sustainable over the long run.

In terms of the forward 12 months Price/Sales, MDB is currently trading at 7.08X, above the Internet – Software industry’s 5.91X. We believe MongoDB’s expanding enterprise clientele and AI momentum justify the premium valuation. The company is benefiting from both operational efficiency and an innovative product portfolio. Can these factors that drove upward guidance revision make MDB stock a compelling buy at current levels? Let’s find out. MDB’s F12M P/S Ratio Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research MDB Rides on New Launches and Customer Wins MongoDB shares have gained 8.7% in the past month, outperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s appreciation of 8.1% and the Zacks Internet – Software industry’s return of 7%. The outperformance has been partly due to a stellar fiscal first-quarter performance with revenues growing year over year, accompanied by raised guidance for fiscal 2026. MDB’s One-Month Price Performance Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research MongoDB continues to gain traction even as rivals like Amazon ’s AMZN DynamoDB and Couchbase BASE expand their presence. Amazon recently introduced multi-region strong consistency for DynamoDB Global Tables, while Couchbase deepened its India footprint with a new state-of-the-art office. Still, MongoDB added the most number of new customers in over six years in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, with strong enterprise wins like CSX and Zepto, highlighting adoption across industries despite moves by Amazon and Couchbase. In the reported quarter, MongoDB launched version 8.0, with adoption doubling that of the previous major version. The company advanced its AI capabilities with Voyage 3.5, which improved embedding accuracy and cut storage costs by more than 80%. MongoDB plans to launch in-platform embedding generation soon, further supporting its position as a unified, AI-ready platform. Revenues grew 22% year over year to $549 million, with Atlas up 26% and operating income more than doubling to $87 million in the fiscal first quarter. For fiscal 2026, MongoDB now expects revenues in the range of $2.25 billion to $2.29 billion, an increase of $10 million from its prior guidance. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $2.94 and $3.12. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MongoDB’s fiscal 2026 revenues is pegged at $2.28 billion, indicating growth of 13.48% on a year-over-year basis. The consensus mark for fiscal 2026 earnings is pinned at $3.03 per share, which has been revised upward by 18.36% over the past 30 days. The estimate indicates a year-over-year decline of 17.21%. MongoDB, Inc. Price and Consensus MongoDB, Inc. Price and Consensus MongoDB, Inc. price-consensus-chart | MongoDB, Inc. Quote MDB Strengthens AI Edge with Integrated Platform MongoDB has been steadily benefiting from the rising demand for AI-powered applications. The company’s document model is well-suited for handling fast-changing, unstructured data required by real-world AI. The acquisition of Voyage AI strengthened this capability further, with Voyage 3.5 improving embedding accuracy and cutting storage costs significantly. MongoDB’s unified platform combines real-time data, retrieval and search, helping developers avoid complex integrations. Companies like LG Uplus are using their AI tools to support thousands of agents with faster, more accurate responses, reinforcing MongoDB’s position in the AI space. An expanding partner base is noteworthy. MongoDB recently announced backup integration with Rubrik RBRK and Cohesity. These partnerships enhance data protection for enterprise customers, especially in hybrid cloud environments. Positive sentiment around MongoDB’s collaboration with Rubrik and Cohesity, along with broader growth signals, has contributed to the recent share price gains. Rubrik and Cohesity’s involvement reinforces MDB’s focus on enterprise-grade resilience. Conclusion: Time to Buy MDB Stock? MongoDB’s shares are undeniably expensive, yet upward estimate revisions and improving profitability give that premium real support. The valuation underscores market confidence in the company’s ability to deliver innovation-led growth, even amid macroeconomic uncertainties. Continued enterprise adoption, product innovation and raised guidance suggest the stock is well-positioned for long-term growth. MongoDB stock is currently trading above the 50-day moving average, indicating a bullish trend.

In the past seven days, it has witnessed one upward estimate revision against none in the opposite direction. Furthermore, the consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $18.7 billion for 2025. It beat earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, with an average surprise of 10.7%. Lincoln National Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Lincoln National Corporation price-eps-surprise | Lincoln National Corporation Quote LNC’s Growth Drivers Lincoln National's revenues are poised for growth, driven by the strong performance of its Annuities and Group Protection segments. Its revenues are supported by higher insurance premiums and fee income. Its enhanced and diversified in-force book, improving average life insurance in-force and margin expansion initiatives, positions the bottom line well for growth. LNC’s annuity business benefits from its wide range of products that cater to consumer preferences. In the first quarter of 2025, the segment’s total sales grew 33% year over year to $3.8 billion. It is making notable progress by evolving its annuity business toward a more balanced mix with a higher proportion of spread-based products. Its Group Protection business continues to see improved growth and profitability trends. Income from operations improved 26% year over year in the first quarter of 2025. Prudent acquisitions in this segment and improving underwriting results will further drive its results. The segment’s operating margin improved 120 basis points in the last reported quarter.

Its quarterly dividends of 45 cents per share, resulting in a dividend yield of 5.2%, comfortably surpass the industry average of 3.2%. Risks for LNC Stock There are some factors, however, that investors should keep a careful eye on. The company’s total expenses have escalated over the last several years due to increasing benefits expenses. Total costs increased 12.7% and 117.9% year over year in 2024 and the first quarter of 2025, respectively. With higher policies, benefit expenses might rise in the coming days, affecting the company's future margins. LNC’s benefit expenses rose 3.2% in the same quarter. LNC carries a significant total debt, which amounted to $5.9 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2025. This leads to a total debt-to-capitalization of 41.7%, higher than the industry average of 14.5%.

These include: UnitedHealth Group ( UNH ) , Amgen ( AMGN ) , Sherwin-Williams ( SHW ) , Merck MRK and Nike ( NKE ) . All were up more than 3% midday. Some of Tuesday's gains were due to Senate passage of President Trump's big tax-and-spending bill after days of sometimes fractious debate. The vote was 51-50 with Vice President J.D.

Only three sectors of the Standard & Poor's 500 were higher, led by the  Consumer Staples stocks such as Hershey ( HSY ) , up 2.7%; Target TGT, up 1.8%; cosmetics maker Estee Lauder ( EL ) , up 1.5%; and J.M. Smucker ( SJM ) , up 1.9%. Big tech stocks were all lower, but the declines were modest. Except for Tesla ( TSLA ) , down 4.3% to about $304. Partly that's due to CEO Elon Musk's ongoing feud with President Trump (see below and partly due to the possibility that tax credits for electric vehicles may be removed by the president's big beautiful tax bill. At 10:10 a.m. EDT, the S&P 500 was off 02% to 6,199. The Nasdaq Composite Index had shed 0.2% to 20,322. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 240 points to 44,325, led by Nike ( NKE ) Apple ( AAPL ) and health insurance giant UnitedHealth Group ( UNH ) . Nvidia ( NVDA ) was the Dow's biggest decliner, down nearly 3% to $153.24. Stock Market Today The first half of the year was a rocky one that ended in the green. As we reported in yesterday's end-of-quarter summary , stocks finished up around 5% after having been in bear market territory. For the first trading day of the quarter, stocks appear headed lower, the long end of the treasury curve higher (yields lower), and both gold and oil are up. ThinkOrSwim What's driving the drop in stocks? Well, what drove the rally? Honestly, stocks are overbought, as I mentioned in my Friday column on TheStreet Pro . Expect some profit taking as investors reduce risk following a strong quarter. Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Monday's opening bell. TIMOTHY A. CLARY/Getty Images Today's news, however, is the tax bill, aka the Big Beautiful Bill. Senate Republicans are still arguing over aspects of the bill as Trump's July 4th deadline approaches. With Democrat senators united against the bill, which will raise the deficit by $3 trillion, Republicans can only afford to lose three votes and are working hard to find ways to support those states with senators that are on the fence. I'll also be watching Tesla ( TSLA ) today as the Trump/Musk feud intensifies. and.. I wrote back in April that Musk could send Tesla stock soaring by leaving the company. If Trump deports Musk, perhaps Tesla shareholders would benefit?

After starting 2025 with so much Trump in our step, it’s been a disappointing six months for retail investors as Bitcoin led the crypto market in H1 , gaining 13% while most altcoins, including Solana , lagged behind. SOL fell 17% in the same period. Despite the slide, the publicly listed Canadian company SOL Strategies Inc. is strategically investing in Solana's growing ecosystem . For its first move, the firm purchased over 52,000 Jito Network (JTO) token s worth $100K. https://twitter.com/solstrategies_/status/1938220759530271058 Moving on to the weekly chart, the market cap of Solana’s leading ecosystem tokens barely moved while the trading volume tanked 28%.

Are You Looking for a Top Momentum Pick?

In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.

While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us. Below, we take a look at SouthState (SSB) , which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions. It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. SouthState currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period. You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>> Set to Beat the Market? In order to see if SSB is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this bank holding company holds up. Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area. For SSB, shares are up 5.82% over the past week while the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry is up 3.24% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 5.66% compares favorably with the industry's 4.28% performance as well. While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of SouthState have risen 12.15%, and are up 21.41% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 10.83% and 14.92%, respectively. Investors should also take note of SSB's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, SSB is averaging 1,567,230 shares for the last 20 days. Earnings Outlook The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with SSB. Over the past two months, 1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost SSB's consensus estimate, increasing from $8.03 to $8.13 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period. Bottom Line Given these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that SSB is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep SouthState on your short list. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

"Eurozone Inflation Hits 2% Target, Raising Chance of ECB Rate Hold",2025-07-02 00:51:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eurozone-inflation-hits-2-target-095000901.html,"The ECB cut its key interest rate last month for an eighth time since June last year. - kirill kudryavtsev/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images Inflation in the eurozone crept up in June, hitting the European Central Bank’s target and raising expectations that policymakers will leave the key interest rate unchanged later this month. Consumer prices were 2.0% higher than the same month last year, up from the 1.9% of May, statistics agency Eurostat said Tuesday, matching expectations from economists polled by The Wall Street Journal.

The Tech-Stock Bargains Hiding in Nvidia’s Shadow Private Equity Caught in Crosshairs of Elise Stefanik’s Attack on Harvard China Is Quickly Eroding America’s Lead in the Global AI Race The ECB cut its key interest rate last month for an eighth time since June last year. Investors anticipate policymakers will reduce rates again later in 2025, but stand pat in their July meeting. That contrasts with the Federal Reserve, which has been more wary of cutting interest rates given the potential impact of the Trump administration’s tariff policies. “I’m not saying mission accomplished, but I say target reached,” ECB President Christine Lagarde said in a panel discussion at the ECB’s monetary policy forum in Sintra, Portugal. However, the bank continues to face “tormented waters” amid continuing economic uncertainty, including from geopolitical developments, she added. “We have to continue to be extremely vigilant,” she said. The June pickup in inflation in the 20-nation currency area was particularly based on energy prices, with the core rate–which excludes more volatile food and energy prices–holding steady, Eurostat said. Oil prices rose sharply after Israel’s attack on Iran in June, but they pared back somewhat after hostilities eased last week. Lagarde warned last week that any blockade by Iran of the flow of oil and gas through the Strait of Hormuz could send prices higher, not just for energy but across a range of products via second-round effects. Even though oil prices have since fallen as the situation calmed, it is an important reminder that geopolitical tensions risk higher inflation, KfW Research economist Stephanie Schoenwald said. “I therefore see distinct obstacles to further interest rate cuts and expect the ECB to pause interest rates in July…Uncertainty remains high,” she noted. But higher oil prices could also hit economic activity, thereby limiting inflation in the longer term, the ECB’s vice president Luis de Guindos said last week. Higher tariffs from the U.S. are also likely to lower inflation, given their effect of damping demand for European goods and that cheaper Asian products could be redirected to Europe. While the ECB can be reassured by inflation reaching its 2% target, the data comes after the bank refreshed its monetary-policy strategy in an effort to learn from the inflation spike after the pandemic and Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The bank said it would act forcefully in circumstances that threaten to push inflation sharply higher or lower. “Appropriately forceful or persistent monetary policy action in response to large, sustained deviations of inflation from the target in either direction is important,” the ECB said.

Why stablecoin issuer Circle wants to be a bank,2025-07-02 00:47:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-stablecoin-issuer-circle-wants-to-be-a-bank-154717140.html,"Circle ( CRCL ), the stablecoin issuer, has formally applied with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to get a national trust bank charter, it said in a press announcement late Monday. If the national bank regulator grants Circle approval, it plans to spin up a national trust bank called First National Digital Currency Bank, N.A. Such a charter would allow the crypto firm to custody and manage the reserve assets behind its own stablecoins and offer other fiduciary services. It would not allow Circle to accept cash deposits or issue loans. “Establishing a national digital currency trust bank of this kind marks a significant milestone in our goal to build an internet financial system that is transparent, efficient and accessible,” Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said in a statement. Reuters was the first to report this development. The move would allow Circle, which has seen its stock soar after its recent IPO, to manage the reserve assets for the stablecoins it issues, thus strengthening the firm’s competitive position. It would also check the box for a requirement all US stablecoin issuers are expected to meet under related legislation. Only one other crypto firm, Anchorage Digital, holds such a license. Currently, Circle’s reserves are held in custody by the Bank of New York Mellon ( BK ) and managed by BlackRock ( BLK ). Circle’s stock opened 2% lower on Tuesday. It's up 470% from its June 5 IPO price of $31. President Donald Trump has promised to make America the “crypto capital of the world” and since he’s taken office, the crypto world has seen a flood of doors open to mainstream finance. And no other corner of the industry so far has attracted so much attention from Wall Street as Circle’s corner, the $253 billion stablecoin market. From Wall Street banks like JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ) and Bank of America ( BAC ) to credit card giants Visa ( V ) and Mastercard ( MA ), fintech firms, and even Big Tech companies, a swath of corporate America is gearing up their stablecoin strategies ahead of passage of the first-ever US stablecoin legislation later this year. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, the value of stablecoins isn’t intended to fluctuate. Instead, they act as a safe haven for investors waiting out crypto’s volatility and in that way are seen as a potential gamechanger in the world of cross-border payments. Mr. stablecoin: Jeremy Allaire, CEO and co-founder of Circle Internet Group at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), in New York City, U.S., June 5, 2025. (REUTERS/Brendan McDermid) · REUTERS / Reuters In practice, stablecoins are managed like money market funds, where for every dollar users put in, issuers must set aside assets in reserve. Known as the GENIUS Act, this stablecoin bill would set standards for how US banks and other financial companies can offer stablecoins and how they would need to manage their reserves in cash and US Treasuries. It would also call for issuers of a certain size to be overseen by the OCC, opening the stablecoin market to a far wider range of players. Another broader crypto market structure bill that is expected to take longer to pass, known as the Clarity Act, will open more doors. This bill includes tokenization, which would clear a path for US firms to begin offering blockchain versions of other assets, such as bank deposits, stocks, and bonds. As issuer of the world’s second-largest stablecoin, USDC ( USDC-USD ), Circle is well positioned to benefit from so much new interest. While no one is quite sure how much stablecoins could change global payments, there's already a flurry of proponents predicting a lot of growth ahead. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told lawmakers last month that passing stablecoin legislation could help push the US stablecoin market beyond $2 trillion by the end of 2028. ""We view CRCL as an investor must-hold, to participate in the new internet-scale financial system built for the next decade,"" Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani, who initiated coverage of Circle on Monday, said in a note. Bernstein expects the global stablecoin market to grow to $4 trillion over the next decade.

Ventas (VTR) Could Be a Great Choice,2025-07-02 00:45:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ventas-vtr-could-great-choice-154507164.html,"Whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities, all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns. However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments. Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases. Ventas in Focus Ventas (VTR) is headquartered in Chicago, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of 7.23% since the start of the year. Currently paying a dividend of $0.48 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 3.04%. In comparison, the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry's yield is 4.96%, while the S&P 500's yield is 1.57%. Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.92 is up 6.7% from last year. Ventas has increased its dividend 1 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 0.37%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Ventas's payout ratio is 59%, which means it paid out 59% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend. Earnings growth looks solid for VTR for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 is $3.44 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 7.84%. Bottom Line Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout. For instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, VTR is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold). Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

These Stocks Soared in the First Half of 2025. Can They Keep It Up?,2025-07-02 00:36:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stocks-soared-first-half-2025-153638676.html,"Michael M. Santiago / Getty Images The tech sector led the major U.S. stock indexes to record highs in the first half of 2025. The stock market shook off one of its worst sell-offs in recent memory to finish the first half of 2025 on a high note. That's lifted stocks associated with AI, crypto—and gold. How did we get here? It's been a ride. Stocks plummeted in early April after President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping global tariffs that threatened to scramble global supply chains, spike prices, and slow growth. Trump's subsequent pause of those tariffs, however, ignited a rally that was further fueled by benign economic data and easing trade tensions. By the end of June, stocks had rebounded to record highs. Wall Street's latest rally has looked a bit like last year's bull market. Artificial intelligence continued to connect many of the market's winners. But a few new themes have emerged amid the Trump administration's shake-up of the status quo. Here, we'll examine the stock market's leaders from the first six months of 2025—and examine how the forces underlying their gains could evolve in the next six. Crypto Stocks Crypto investors have been handsomely rewarded for the industry’s spending on November’s election. The industry last year spent more than $100 million in support of pro-crypto candidates. In January, the “most pro-crypto Congress” in history was sworn in and Washington wasted little time giving the industry what it wanted. Federal regulators have dropped pending litigation against cryptocurrency companies. Trump signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin reserve. In May, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which would establish a framework for the regulation of cryptocurrencies, was introduced in the House of Representatives. And the Senate in June passed the GENIUS Act , legislation that establishes rules governing stablecoins. That's helped grow the cryptocurrency market's value to more than $3.2 trillion. Washington’s embrace, however, has also boosted related stocks this year. Robinhood ( HOOD ) stock more than doubled in price in the first half, while Coinbase ( COIN ) shares rose 41%. Circle Internet Group’s ( CRCL ) shares more than doubled during the stablecoin issuer’s first day of trading in early June; the stock rose nearly 750% in the two weeks after its debut. The cryptocurrency legislation working its way through Congress is expected to have little trouble making its way to Trump’s desk for signature in the second half of this year. Trump and his family may continue feeding the industry’s animal spirits with new crypto ventures . AI Monetizers Analysts came into the year expecting the group of stocks considered emblematic of the AI trade to change. That has panned out to an extent. Leadership was expected to shift from AI infrastructure stocks—companies like Nvidia ( NVDA ), whose chips fill the data centers that cloud computing giants like Amazon ( AMZN ) and Microsoft ( MSFT ) use to train and run AI models—to software and services providers developing and monetizing AI applications. Palantir ( PLTR ) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 in the first half of the year; its impressive sales and earnings growth have been driven primarily by its AI software. Social media giant Meta Platforms ( META ) is the Magnificent Seven’s best performer year-to-date thanks in part to its success introducing AI features that have improved performance metrics. Software stocks are expected to continue to outperform as they improve AI models and develop new applications. They could also benefit from their relative insulation from trade uncertainty, which dented the overall stock market’s returns in the first half. AI Infrastructure AI infrastructure, a theme that outperformed for most of 2024, continued to be a winner on Wall Street in the first half of this year. Tech giants Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet ( GOOG ), and Meta looked through economic uncertainty and stood by plans to cumulatively spend hundreds of billions of dollars on property, buildings, and equipment this year. Much of that spending is earmarked for the technology required to develop and run advanced AI, like Nvidia chips, Super Micro Computer ( SMCI ) servers, and Amphenol ( APH ) fiber optic cables. Those hardware suppliers saw their shares rise 18%, 61%, and 42%, respectively, in the first half. The buildout of power-hungry data centers boosted the stocks of nuclear power providers, whose electricity is in demand from tech companies who say they are looking to shrink their carbon footprints. Shares of Constellation Energy ( CEG ) and Vistra ( VST ) advanced 44% and 41%, respectively. But bringing new nuclear power online is a long process, and data centers are in the meantime relying on natural gas, boosting the stocks of gas-fired plant operators like NRG Energy ( NRG ), up 78% year-to-date, and gas turbine makers like GE Vernova ( GEV ), up 61%. Experts expect the AI infrastructure trade to be resilient. Tech giants “are planning for long-term data center capacity requirements and won’t alter their investment plans based on tariff regimes that change from week to week,” said Shaon Baqui, tech equities analyst at Janus Henderson Investors. Gold Miners The mood globally in the first half of 2025 was tense, to put it mildly. That was good for gold. In five months, the second Trump administration launched a global trade war targeting friends and foes alike; opened questions about America's commitment to longtime alliances like NATO; increased America’s involvement in Israel’s conflict with its neighbors; and ratcheted up tensions with China. Investors who sought stability turned to gold, a time-honored safe-haven asset. Gold prices climbed to record high after record high, peaking at more than $3,450 on June 13, the day Israel launched attacks on Iran’s nuclear program. Shares of gold miner Newmont ( NEM ) followed prices higher, rising 56% over the first half of the year. Fellow miners Barrick ( B ) and Agnico Eagle Mines ( AEM ) advanced 34% and 52%, respectively. Central banks, wary of inflation and their reliance on U.S.-controlled reserve assets , have been major buyers of gold in recent years. Demand for gold is expected to remain high for the foreseeable future as governments around the world seek to hedge against elevated geopolitical tensions and an uncertain global economic outlook. The World Gold Council’s most recent Central Bank Gold Reserves survey found that nearly all central banks expect global gold reserves to increase over the next 12 months. A record 43% of respondents said they plan to add to their gold holdings over the same period. Read the original article on Investopedia"

The J. M. Smucker Slides 12% in a Month: How to Play SJM Stock,2025-07-02 00:24:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/j-m-smucker-slides-12-152400602.html,"The J. M. Smucker Company SJM has seen its shares plunge 12.3% over the past month, significantly underperforming the industry’s modest 1% decline and the S&P 500’s 4.1% growth. The stock also lagged behind the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector, which fell 2% during the same period. This sharp pullback reflects a mix of broader macroeconomic challenges and company-specific headwinds. The J.M. Smucker also underperformed some of its peers, such as The Hershey Company HSY, McCormick & Company, Incorporated MKC and General Mills, Inc. GIS. Shares of Hershey and McCormick have gained 2.8% and 3.2%, respectively. In contrast, General Mills saw its stock decline 4.3% in the past month. Investors remain divided on whether The J.M. Smucker is poised for further downside or approaching a potential rebound. SJM Price Performance vs. Industry, S&P 500 & Sector Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research As of the last trading session, SJM closed at $98.20, near its 52-week low of $93.30, attained on June 18, 2025. The J.M. Smucker stock is trading below critical technical thresholds, including its 50 and 200-day moving averages. SJM is currently trading at a discount to both its historical averages and industry peers, largely due to its recent share underperformance. The stock's forward 12-month P/E ratio stands at 10.44, below its one-year median of 11.07 and well below the industry average of 15.85. While the lower valuation may reflect perceived risks, it also underscores the market’s cautious sentiment, especially when compared to peers like Hershey, McCormick, and General Mills, which are trading at significantly higher multiples of 27.02X, 23.81X and 13.94X, respectively. SJM P/E Ratio (Forward 12 Months) Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research What’s Weighing on The J.M. Smucker’s Growth? The J.M. Smucker is contending with a series of strategic and operational headwinds, the most pressing of which centers on its underperforming Sweet Baked Snacks segment, led by the Hostess brand. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, the segment reported a 14% decline in comparable sales, driven by sluggish consumer demand amid persistent inflation and diminished discretionary income. These external pressures were compounded by internal missteps in distribution, merchandising, and execution, further weighing on performance. Another significant challenge is the surge in green coffee prices, which have reached record highs. This inflationary trend forced SJM to implement multiple price increases across its coffee portfolio. While the company managed to preserve margins through responsible pricing, it faces an increasing risk of volume loss due to demand elasticity. This issue is further complicated by tariffs on imported green coffee, mainly sourced from Brazil and Vietnam, adding further margin pressure. The J.M. Smucker’s pet food segment also showed signs of stress. Net sales declined 13%, hit by retailer inventory reductions and weak demand for dog snacks. Although Meow Mix showed some resilience, the broader category remains soft as consumers cut back on discretionary spending. SJM faces exposure to global trade tensions, particularly via tariffs and regulatory changes. Though much of its production is U.S.-based, key inputs like green coffee are subject to import duties. As a result, the company is actively exploring alternative sourcing and pricing strategies to mitigate these risks. Nevertheless, external volatility remains a structural headwind. Looking ahead, the company has issued a cautious outlook for fiscal 2026. SJM expects adjusted earnings in the range of $8.50 to $9.50 for the full year, which includes material headwinds from coffee elasticity, increased marketing investments, tariff impacts, and continued weakness in the Sweet Baked Snacks segment. Notably, in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, adjusted earnings are expected to decline approximately 25% year over year, reinforcing concerns about near-term margin pressure. The J.M. Smucker Estimates: Trouble Still Brewing? Reflecting cautious sentiment around The J.M. Smucker, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share (EPS) has seen downward revisions. Over the past seven days, the consensus estimate has declined for the current quarter by 10 cents to $9.28 per share and fiscal year by 15 cents to $9.99 per share. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.) Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Here’s How to Play SJM Stock The J.M. Smucker Company is navigating a difficult environment marked by weak consumer demand, rising commodity costs, tariff headwinds, and underperformance in key segments, such as sweet baked snacks and pet food. These challenges have been compounded by internal execution issues and downward revisions to earnings estimates, signaling growing investor concern. The stock has also fallen below key technical support levels, reflecting continued bearish sentiment. With limited near-term growth catalysts and ongoing margin pressures, SJM’s outlook remains unfavorable. Investors may be better served by exploring more stable opportunities.

Wall Street analysts start bullish on Omada Health on chronic care market growth,2025-07-02 00:18:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-start-bullish-151838167.html,"Investing.com -- Barclays, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley issued bullish rating on Omada Health stock saying the virtual‑care provider could capture more of the large market for diabetes, hypertension and weight‑management services. Barclays began at “overweight” with a $21 price target, arguing Omada’s new GLP‑1 weight‑loss programme should speed adoption of its digital coaching platform. Invest in Gold Thor Metals Group: Best Overall Gold IRA Learn More Priority Gold: Up to $15k in Free Silver + Zero Account Fees on Qualifying Purchase Learn More American Hartford Gold: #1 Precious Metals Dealer in the Nation Learn More Powered by Money.com - Yahoo may earn commission from the links above. Goldman Sachs started at “buy” and set the Street‑high target of $29, saying a focus on measured clinical outcomes can help the company outgrow peers. JP Morgan initiated at “overweight” with a $19 target and projected roughly 24% compound annual revenue growth through 2027 as Omada expands its corporate client base. Morgan Stanley also rated the stock “overweight” and set a $25 target, citing scope for margin gains as artificial‑intelligence tools automate parts of the service. The brokerages see Omada tapping a U.S. population in which more than 150 million people live with at least one chronic condition. Several analysts said last year’s introduction of an integrated care track for users of GLP‑1 weight‑loss drugs, and recent partnerships with pharmacy‑benefit giants CVS Caremark and Express Scripts, should widen the company’s reach. San Francisco‑based Omada raised $158 million in its Nasdaq debut on June 6, pricing shares at $19. The stock has since traded below that level but is up roughly 20% from its low. Analysts said Omada’s move toward break‑even, targeted for the second half of 2026 or 2027 depending on the forecast, gives management flexibility to invest in new products while trimming debt. The company was valued at about $1.4 billion, or just under three times projected 2026 revenue, a discount to digital‑health peers, the broker notes said.

Fed’s Powell says tariff hit to consumers likely coming this summer,2025-07-02 00:07:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-powell-says-tariff-hit-150707472.html,"US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday warned that Americans would likely feel the impact of tariffs on prices in the coming weeks. “We’re watching. We expect to see over the summer some higher readings,” Powell told a panel led by the European Central Bank in Portugal, adding that high levels of uncertainty remain. The Fed has sought to balance economic forecasting, which projects increased inflation from tariffs, and recent data, which has been more muted. The bank is expected to make at least one interest rate cut this year, although Powell refused to confirm other governors’ hints that a cut could come this month . That could further stoke US President Donald Trump’s ire: Powell’s remarks came a day after Trump again urged him to resign. — Paige Bruton"
BlackRock Dissolves Private Credit Partnership With Mubadala in Asia,2025-07-02 00:04:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-dissolves-private-credit-partnership-150400534.html,"BlackRock Inc. BLK and Mubadala Investment have jointly agreed to end their Asian private credit collaboration, which focused on investments in China and Indonesia, due to challenges in sourcing deals. This was reported by Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter. As part of the partnership launched in 2023, Mubadala had committed to matching every U.S. dollar that BlackRock invested. The partnership has allocated only a small portion of its capital so far, as deal origination in China has been challenging, with the targeted return profile being in the mid-teens range. Christopher Ganis, head of private credit in Indonesia, departed in the early days of the partnership, making deal origination in the country more challenging. Efforts by BLK to Boost Private Markets Offerings BlackRock has been aiming to boost its private markets capabilities to generate higher returns. In March 2025, it acquired Preqin for $3.2 billion to enhance its private markets offerings. In December 2024, it agreed to acquire HPS Investment Partners to deepen its presence in the private credit market. In October 2024, the company acquired Global Infrastructure Partners to enhance its infrastructure offerings and origination capabilities. Additionally, in its investor presentation last month, BLK predicted that the private credit market could expand to $4.5 trillion by 2030, and hence it targeted $400 billion in private markets fundraising by that time. Recently, BLK got selected by Great Gray Trust Company, LLC to offer a retirement solution featuring private equity and credit exposure. BlackRock has also collaborated with Partners Group to combine a varied pool of private assets into a single portfolio of alternatives for retail clients. BLK’s Price Performance & Zacks Rank Over the past year, BLK shares have gained 33%, outperforming the industry’s 20.7% growth.

Other Firms Expanding in the Private Credit Market This February, JPMorgan JPM announced an additional $50 billion allocation toward direct lending, solidifying its presence in the credit market. The move, unveiled at its 30th annual Global Leveraged Finance Conference, signals the company’s intent to become a dominant force in private credit. Since 2021, JPMorgan has deployed more than $10 billion across 100+ private credit transactions, leveraging its extensive client base and vast origination platform. The bank’s partnerships with multiple co-lenders have further strengthened its position, bringing in an additional $15 billion in capital. According to Kevin Foley, global head of Capital Markets at JPM, the company’s ability to integrate its origination platform with lender partners has significantly increased deal flow and lending capacity. In 2024, Citigroup C inked a deal with Apollo Global APO for its subsidiary and certain affiliates of Apollo to establish a revolutionary $25-billion private credit, direct lending program. The program will initially focus on North America, potentially expanding to additional geographies. Both Citigroup and Apollo expect the program to finance approximately $25 billion of debt opportunities over the next several years, including corporate and financial sponsor transactions.

Global dividend funds attract inflows on rate-cut hopes and market jitters,2025-07-01 23:47:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-dividend-funds-attract-inflows-144738286.html,"By Patturaja Murugaboopathy (Reuters) -Global funds that invest in dividend-paying stocks are drawing strong flows this year, following two years of tepid investor demand, as investors seek assets with a stable income while they navigate geopolitical and economic tensions. Higher dividend-yielding stocks have become popular as the technology sector, which was last year’s standout performer, lags behind dividend-heavy sectors such as utilities and energy in 2025. Global dividend-focused exchange-traded funds attracted $23.7 billion in inflows in the first half of 2025, the most in three years, according to Lipper data from LSEG. ""Consistent dividend growth signals a company’s managers are disciplined at capital allocation and confident about future business prospects,"" said Steve Watson, an equity portfolio manager at Capital Group. ""With tariff negotiations likely to linger for months, dividend growers could provide portfolios with a measure of stability when markets become volatile."" Sector-wise, energy led the way with a global dividend yield of 4.75%, followed by real estate at 3.7%, utilities at 3.3%, and financials at 3%, according to LSEG data. By region, Europe had the highest dividend yield of 3%, while Asia-Pacific's dividend yield was 2.6% and the U.S. lagged with an average dividend yield of 1.4%. ""With policymakers widely expected to trim rates later in the year, the bond side of the ledger could see coupons ratchet lower, while a broad swath of companies still have room to hold or even lift their dividends,"" said Chad Harmer, chief investment officer at Harmer Wealth Management. ""If that script plays out, the income gap should tilt further in equities’ favour."" The iShares International Select Dividend ETF has gained nearly 26% this year, while the Xtrackers MSCI EAFE High Dividend Yield Equity ETF and the Schwab International Dividend Equity ETF are up around 18% each. In comparison, the MSCI World Index has returned 8.5% year-to-date. (Reporting by Patturaja Murugaboopathy in Bengaluru; Editing by Vidya Ranganathan and Hugh Lawson)"
Former E*Trade CEO: How to get the opening of private markets for retail investors right—with the benefit of hindsight,2025-07-01 23:20:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/led-e-trade-now-lead-142058489.html,"Mitch Caplan led E*Trade as CEO during the electronic trading revolution, guiding the company through its transformation into a full-service financial platform serving millions of retail investors. He now serves as interim CEO and chairman of the board at Yieldstreet. In 1983, a dentist in Michigan executed the world’s first online trade from his home computer, sending an order through Trade Plus—a precursor to E*Trade. At a time when individual investing meant calling a broker during business hours and relying on their recommendations, this simple transaction marked a radical departure. Overnight, technology shifted the balance of power from institutions to individuals, permanently reshaping how the world would interact with markets. Merrill Lynch’s chairman Daniel Tully captured the establishment’s reaction: “The do-it-yourself model of investing, centered on Internet trading, should be regarded as a serious threat to Americans’ financial lives.” Some of the skepticism proved well-founded. But by and large, people embraced these new tools and transformed both the market and their financial futures. Within a decade, millions would be researching, managing, and executing trades on their own terms. Today, 43.1% of U.S. households’ financial assets are tied to the stock market—up from just 12.3% in 1983—a transformation that would have been unimaginable when that Michigan dentist placed his pioneering trade. As CEO of E*Trade at the time, I watched the forces that drove this revolution firsthand. Now, I see the same factors converging in private markets. (Disclaimer: I currently lead Yieldstreet, which among other things helps retail investors access private markets.) We’ve already proven that technology can democratize closed markets. The question is whether we’ll design this next wave of access—to private markets—with a greater commitment to serving and protecting the average investor. What’s driving the trend? First, low-cost, accessible investment vehicles are emerging. Just as ETFs and index funds dramatically lowered barriers to stock market participation, new fractional ownership models and specialized funds are making private assets available at lower minimums. Second, technological infrastructure is catching up. As Larry Fink noted in his annual letter, “With clearer, more timely data, it becomes possible to index private markets just like we do now with the S&P 500.” BlackRock’s acquisition of Preqin —a provider of private markets data that tracks over 190,000 funds and 60,000 managers—signals a push for the same transparency in private markets that investors expect in public ones. Third, investor education is evolving alongside access. When E*Trade and Schwab opened the doors to trading, they created a massive knowledge gap. The Motley Fool, Investopedia, and countless creators emerged to fill it. Today, asset managers like Hamilton Lane and Apollo are building robust educational infrastructure for private markets, and I expect a similar explosion of independent educators, YouTube channels, and new media platforms dedicated to demystifying these new assets. Fourth and finally, marketing is normalizing what was once exclusive. In the 2000s, E*Trade’s Super Bowl baby became a cultural touchstone and a Trojan horse for a broader message: Stocks and bonds were no longer reserved for Wall Street. That same democratizing message is beginning to reshape how we think about private markets. However, entrenched interests are fighting this change harder than they fought electronic trading. The same industry that warned electronic trading would harm small investors now claims private markets are too complex for ordinary people. Meanwhile, the accredited investor rules—based on wealth, rather than investing knowledge—arbitrarily exclude 88% of Americans from these types of investments. Learning from the past The rise of electronic trading expanded opportunity but also created new risks. The dot-com bubble saw retail investors lose trillions as platforms prioritized volume over outcomes, gamifying investing rather than educating investors. If private markets open without proper guardrails, we risk repeating these mistakes at an even greater scale. The solution starts with purpose-built products. Instead of retrofitting institutional vehicles with high fees and lock-ups, we need investments designed for individuals. Imagine target-date funds incorporating private assets for savers with long-time horizons. Or technology that makes private market performance as transparent as checking your 401(k). This transformation is overdue. While retail investors have gained easy access to public stocks, they’ve been locked out of private markets—where most value creation in the economy occurs. The companies staying private longer, the real estate developments reshaping cities, the innovation happening in venture-backed startups—all of it has been reserved for institutions and the ultra-wealthy. That’s finally changing. This time, however, we have the benefit of hindsight—and the responsibility to use it.

"PLMR Outperforms Industry, Trades at Premium: How to Play the Stock",2025-07-01 23:17:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/plmr-outperforms-industry-trades-premium-141700203.html,"Shares of Palomar Holdings, Inc. PLMR have gained 85.4% in the past year, outperforming its industry, the Finance sector and the Zacks S&P 500 composite’s growth of 19.5%, 20.9% and 12.5%, respectively. The insurer has a market capitalization of $4.12 billion. The average volume of shares traded in the last three months was 0.3 million. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Shares of Palomar Holdings closed at $154.25 on Monday and are trading above the 200-day simple moving average of $122.68, indicating solid upward momentum. PLMR Shares are Expensive Its shares are trading at a premium to the Zacks Property and Casualty Insurance industry. Its price-to-book value of 5.22X is higher than the industry average of 1.57X. Shares of other insurers like The Allstate Corporation ALL, Arch Capital Group Ltd. ACGL and The Progressive Corporation PGR are also trading at a multiple higher than the industry average. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research PLMR’s Encouraging Growth Projection The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Palomar Holdings’ 2025 earnings per share indicates a year-over-year increase of 39.2%. The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $782.98 million, implying a year-over-year improvement of 42.5%. The consensus estimate for 2026 earnings per share and revenues indicates an increase of 17% and 26.3%, respectively, from the corresponding 2025 estimates. PLMR has an impressive Growth Score of B. This style score helps analyze the growth prospects of a company. Optimist Analyst Sentiment on PLMR Four of the six analysts covering the stock have raised estimates for 2025, and three of the five analysts have raised the same for 2026 over the past 30 days. Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 and 2026 earnings has moved up 2% and 1.5%, respectively, in the past 30 days. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Average Target Price for PLMR Suggests Upside Based on short-term price targets offered by six analysts, the Zacks average price target is $183 per share. The average suggests a potential 19.31% upside from the last closing price. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research PLMR’s Return on Capital Return on equity is a measure of profitability reflecting how efficiently the company is utilizing its shareholders’ value. Return on equity of 20.5% compared favorably with the industry’s average of 7.8%. Also, the return on invested capital in the trailing 12-months was 19.9%, better than the industry average of 5.9%, reflecting the company’s efficiency in utilizing funds to generate income. Factors Driving PLMR Palomar’s fee-based platform, PLMR-FRONT, is positioned to drive medium-term growth. The addition of this revenue stream is expected to strengthen its earnings foundation. The increasing volume of policies across multiple business lines, strong retention rates, expansion into new geographic areas and distribution channels, and the formation of new partnerships are expected to drive premiums. Palomar also projects that crop insurance will contribute around $200 million in premiums by 2025. PLMR identifies Surety as an attractive, long-term growth opportunity. Like crop insurance, Surety is not correlated with the traditional property and casualty insurance cycle, offering diversification and stability. Net investment income is expected to rise, supported by a high-quality fixed-income portfolio, higher average investment balances, and improved yields. This solid investment base is poised to generate strong returns. Palomar’s risk transfer strategy reduces exposure to major catastrophic events, helping to stabilize earnings and improve its combined ratio. Financially, the insurer maintains a strong capital position and a debt-free balance sheet. As part of its shareholder return initiatives, Palomar continues to execute share buybacks. With these strengths in place, Palomar raised adjusted net income guidance to a range of $186-$200 million in 2025, which includes $8-$12 million of additional catastrophe losses. Final Take on PLMR Palomar is positioning itself as a key player in the crop insurance sector, with its growing emphasis on Surety signaling strong prospects for future expansion. The company’s diverse product suite, ongoing geographic growth, onboarding of new producers, strategic partnerships with other insurers, and implemented rate increases are all poised to fuel its momentum. As a specialty insurer, Palomar leverages reinsurance to effectively mitigate risk exposure. This strategy enables the company to underwrite policies with sufficient coverage while managing potential losses, contributing to a stable and resilient business model. Given its strong fundamentals and growth potential, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, despite its premium valuation, appears to be a compelling investment.

Netflix’s Lofty Valuation Has Even Bullish Investors Nervous,2025-07-01 23:15:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-lofty-valuation-even-bullish-095619842.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Netflix Inc. investors face a dilemma: Continue to bet on a stock that has delivered best-in-class returns over the past year or reconsider shares that increasingly look like they’re priced for perfection. Most Read from Bloomberg Struggling Downtowns Are Looking to Lure New Crowds Philadelphia Transit System Votes to Cut Service by 45%, Hike Fares Sprawl Is Still Not the Answer California Exempts Building Projects From Environmental Law The streaming giant’s stock price has nearly doubled over the last 12 months amid growth from advertising sales, subscription price increases and limited exposure to tariffs. While that makes it one of the best performing S&P 500 members over that span, it’s also boosted its valuation to 45 times expected earnings for the next year. In comparison, Nvidia Corp. is priced at 32 times while the Nasdaq 100 is at 27 times. Such a premium valuation, Netflix’s highest since 2021 — when its growth was being supercharged by the pandemic — is making even bullish investors wary of a potential sell off. Second-quarter earnings are due on July 17. “I feel really good about its fundamentals, in terms of its pricing power, ad business and move into live events, but expectations have gotten to the point that any disappointment would be a risk,” said Michael Smith, senior portfolio manager and head of growth equity at Allspring Global Investments. After tumbling in 2022 amid slumping subscriber growth, Netflix shares have roared back as the company cracked down on password sharing and turned to advertising to boost revenue. Meanwhile, live events like WWE Raw are helping attract new subscribers. Netflix is the fourth best-performing stock in the Nasdaq 100 this year and now boasts a market value of $570 billion, bigger than Mastercard Inc. and Exxon Mobil Corp. Netflix’s revenue is expected to rise 14% in 2025, down from 16% growth in 2024, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. While that’s a vast improvement from 2022, when revenue rose by about 6.5%, it pales in comparison to 2020 and 2021, when Netflix’s sales jumped 24% and 19%, respectively, as pandemic era lockdowns sent subscriber growth soaring. Still, most analysts on Wall Street remain bullish on the stock with a slate of programming this year that includes NFL games, boxing and new seasons of the popular shows Squid Game and Stranger Things. Last month, Oppenheimer & Co. described Netflix’s outlook as “ironclad” and raised the price target on the stock, one of many to do so in June. However, the shares have risen faster than analysts have upped their projections, leaving Netflix trading roughly 10% above the average price target of $1,217, suggesting limited upside potential over the coming months. Plenty of investors are undeterred by Netflix’s valuation. Ken Mahoney, chief executive officer of Mahoney Asset Management, acknowledges it’s a steep price to pay but believes Netflix’s market dominance justifies the premium. “People often miss great companies because they worry about valuation, and I don’t have a problem spending up for what Netflix offers,” Mahoney said. Netflix is “doing all the right things and is like a snowball getting bigger as it rolls downhill.” Another factor that’s helped power Netflix’s rally is that the stock has become much more widely owned. According to Bank of America data published at the end of May, Netflix was owned by 49% of long-only funds, making it the ninth-most-widely-held technology stock. About 14% of such funds held the stock in early 2016. Despite all of the tailwinds in Netflix’s favor, Allspring Global’s Smith questions what will be the next driver of Netflix’s rally given the high valuation. “There is a lot of fundamental momentum at Netflix, but the valuation backdrop has changed, and it is hard to say that this kind of multiple expansion is repeatable,” Smith said. Tech Chart of the Day Chinese automakers continued to expand their European foothold in May, capturing the highest share ever of hybrid-car sales and the biggest slice of the electric-vehicle market in 10 months. Manufacturers led by BYD Co. and SAIC Motor Corp.’s MG surpassed 9% share in both of those categories, based on figures from industry researcher Dataforce. Including combustion-engine models, European registrations of Chinese-branded cars topped 5% for the first time. Top Tech News Apple Inc. is considering using artificial intelligence technology from Anthropic PBC or OpenAI to power a new version of Siri, sidelining its own in-house models in a potentially blockbuster move aimed at turning around its flailing AI effort. Meta Platforms Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg announced a major restructuring of the company’s artificial intelligence group, including a commitment to developing AI “superintelligence,” or systems that can complete tasks as well as or even better than humans. The prospective buyer of TikTok’s American operations cited by President Donald Trump is the same investor consortium including Oracle Corp., Blackstone Inc. and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, whose bid for the app had stalled amid US-China trade tensions, according to a person familiar with the matter. Nintendo Co. pulled its products from Amazon.com Inc.’s US site after a disagreement over unauthorized sales, meaning the e-commerce company missed out on the recent debut of Nintendo’s Switch 2 — the biggest game console launch of all time. Microsoft Corp.’s top sales executive is planning to take a two-month sabbatical, a move that coincides with an expected wave of terminations targeting his organization. Wolfspeed Inc., a chipmaker caught in President Donald Trump’s push to reshape Biden-era tech subsidies, filed bankruptcy to enact a creditor-backed plan to slash $4.6 billion in debt.

This Is The Only Stock Cathie Wood Bought on Monday,2025-07-01 23:15:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/only-stock-cathie-wood-bought-141500851.html,"Key Points Cathie Wood bought shares of AMD on Monday, adding the semiconductor stock to some of her Ark Invest funds. Wood is riding higher this year, as the 24% year-to-date gain for her largest ETF is quadrupling the S&P 500's return. AMD isn't growing as quickly as Nvidia, but the rising AI tide is lifting all chips. 10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro Devices › Cathie Wood has been particularly busy on the trading floor as the market has rallied. She's adding to some of her positions and pruning others. However, there was only one stock she was buying on the final trading day in June. The CEO, co-founder, and chief investment officer at Ark Invest added more shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) to three of her exchange-traded funds (ETFs). That was the only name on her buy list on Monday. Wood has hit a few rough patches since the blowout 2020 performance that put her family of aggressive growth ETFs on the map. She's in a good groove right now. Ark Innovation ETF (NYSEMKT: ARKK) -- her largest fund and one of the recipients of fresh AMD shares -- closed out the first half of the year with a 24% gain. That's more than quadruple the S&P 500 's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) comparable 6% return through the first six months of 2025. Ark Invest was more active than usual as stock prices rallied through June. Wood pared back to trading in three stocks on Monday, and two of them were partial sells. Let's take a closer look at the lone buy, AMD. Putting her chips on the table Ark Invest has been building up its stake in AMD in recent weeks. Wood is buying the maker of microprocessors and graphics processing units (GPUs) on the way up. Shares are lower than they were a year ago, but they've moved 17% higher in 2025, nearly tripling the market's return. AMD has been particularly buoyant lately, soaring 86% since bottoming out in early April. If AMD has nearly doubled in the past three months, only to climb just 17% over the past six months, you can imagine the big hole it has had to claw its way out of this year. AMD was a latecomer to the artificial intelligence ( AI ) revolution. Its revenue declined 4% in 2023. AI chip leader Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) saw its business more than double in its comparable fiscal year. AMD has been gaining momentum on the data center outfitter bandwagon. Since the fiscal second quarter of 2023, when revenue clocked in with an 18% year-over-year slide, AMD's top-line growth has accelerated in all but one of seven subsequent quarters. The turnaround has culminated in a 36% jump in its latest quarter. It even hosted a well-received AI event last month, collecting several bullish analyst notes in the process. AMD is no Nvidia. The country's most valuable company by market cap saw its revenue skyrocket 69% for its latest fiscal quarter. However, there is obviously going to be more than just one winner as global demand for generative AI translates into a surge in demand. Image source: Getty Images. Taking the short way back AMD stock plummeted through the first three months of this year for the same reasons Nvidia proved mortal. The initial downticks came when China's DeepSeek announced that it could deliver decent generative AI using older and cheaper secondhand Nvidia chips. That revelation sent shivers down the spines of every public AI player. The next big hit for AMD and its chip-churning peers was the rising trade war with China. Investors were understandably skittish when tariffs were announced. The fears have cautiously subsided for the most part, but AI chip specialists are still dealing with export restrictions into China. Nvidia already took a $4.5 billion inventory charge in its previous quarter, and it's modeling $8 billion in sales it will have to forgo in the current quarter. Smaller AMD is bracing investors for a $700 million hit. These are big numbers, but the stocks have rallied since early April as demand for high-tech GPUs is proving potent. The prospects are bright, even with the perhaps temporarily suppressed sales into the world's second most populous nation. AMD's strongest quarter in nearly three years was fueled by a 57% jump in its data center business to propel overall revenue growth of 36%. Operating income and adjusted earnings increased 57% and 55%, respectively. AMD's bottom-line surge is making the stock seem reasonably priced despite the 86% burst since April 8. AMD is trading for 37 times this year's projected earnings, dropping to a multiple just shy of 25 if we look out to next year. This isn't a traditionally cheap valuation, but it's not outlandish, with analysts forecasting a 48% earnings improvement for AMD next year. Wood has a lot of aggressive growth stocks in her ETF portfolios. It's worth noting when she buys only one stock. Should you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?

BAE Systems Gains 26.9% in Past 3 Months: How to Play the Stock?,2025-07-01 23:14:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bae-systems-gains-26-9-141400904.html,"Shares of BAE Systems Plc BAESY have gained 26.9% in the past three months, outperforming the Zacks Aerospace – Defense Equipment industry’s growth of 23.6% as well as the broader Zacks Aerospace sector’s rise of 18.5%. It also outperformed the S&P 500’s growth of 9.5%. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Other defense equipment stocks, such as Astronics Corporation ATRO and Curtiss-Wright Corporation CW, have also outperformed the industry in the past three months. Shares of ATRO have gained 36%, while shares of CW have gained 49.9%. With BAESY’s robust performance on the bourses, some investors may consider buying this stock right away. However, before taking any decision, it is important to understand the reasons behind this robust performance. Does the company have what it takes to continue the momentum, or are there risks that may affect its future growth? The idea is to help investors make a more insightful decision. What Caused BAESY’s Shares to Rise? BAESY’s robust performance on the bourses seems to have been influenced by its capacity expansion efforts and strategic collaborations. Notably, in June 2025, BAESY opened a cutting-edge shipbuilding facility, the Janet Harvey Hall, at its shipyard in Glasgow. Spanning 170 meters in length and 80 meters in width, the facility is large enough to assemble two Type 26 frigates side-by-side and is equipped with two 100-tonne and two 20-tonne cranes. The opening marks a major leap forward in shipbuilding efficiency and reinforces BAESY’s role as a prominent forerunner in naval innovation and capability. In the same month, BAE Systems opened a new submarine engineering hub in Coventry, marking a significant expansion of its defense operations. The state-of-the-art facility will focus on critical engineering work to support the UK's next-generation nuclear-powered attack submarines, known as the SSN-AUKUS program. Moreover, BAESY, alongside Leonardo and Japan Aircraft Industrial Enhancement Co. Ltd., launched a new joint venture company called Edgewing for the development and integration of the next-generation combat aircraft under its Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP), which aims to deliver a cutting-edge fighter jet by 2035. These strategic moves must have boosted investors’ confidence in this stock, which got duly reflected in the form of a share price hike. What Lies Ahead for BAESY Stock? BAE Systems is well-positioned to benefit from several favorable contracts and strategic moves that support its long-term growth. In June 2025, the company secured an approximate $259.1 million (£204.6 million) funding from the UK Ministry of Defence to develop and integrate advanced radar systems into the latest Royal Air Force’s Eurofighter Typhoon jets, strengthening its role in key defense programs. In the same month, BAE was awarded a $1.2 billion contract to design and build a next-generation missile warning and tracking satellite system for the U.S. Space Force. BAE Systems is also working closely with the U.S. Army to deliver significant upgrades to the battle-proven M109 Paladin platform, aligning with continued modernization efforts. Moreover, to expand its footprint in space technology, the company has recently partnered with South Korea's Hanwha Systems to jointly develop advanced multi-sensor satellite systems. Such initiatives should bolster BEASY’s operational results, particularly its top and bottom-line performances in the long run. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for BAESY’s long-term (three-to-five-years) earnings growth rate is pegged at 13.4%. However, persistent global supply-chain pressures continue to pose a risk for aerospace-defense stocks like BAESY, ATRO and CW, which remain exposed to ongoing supply-chain disruptions due to factors such as labor and material shortages, as well as geopolitical tensions. In particular, developments in the U.S.-China relationship and the situation involving Taiwan can affect the global flow of essential raw materials and components. This, in turn, may affect production timelines and cost structures, potentially weighing on BAESY’s operational efficiency in the near future. Now let’s take a quick sneak peek at its near-term estimates to check what trend that reflects. BAESY’s Near-Term Estimates The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BAESY’s 2025 and 2026 revenues indicates a solid improvement of 62.6% and 7.4%, respectively, from the prior-year levels. The same for its earnings also indicate a double-digit year-over-year improvement. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for BAESY’s 2025 and 2026 earnings per share has moved up considerably in the past 60 days, indicating analysts’ increasing confidence in the stock’s earnings-generating capabilities. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research BAESY Shares Trading at a Discount BAESY stock is trading at a discount, with its forward 12-month Price/Earnings (P/E F12M) being 24.51X compared with its industry average of 49.32X. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Its industry peers, ATRO and CW, are also trading at a discount. ATRO is trading at a P/E F12M of 20.11X, while CW is trading at a P/E F12M of 37.46X.

Fed rate cut bets rise after Powell doesn't rule out July,2025-07-01 23:08:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-rate-cut-bets-rise-140836450.html,"(Reuters) -Financial market bets rose that the Federal Reserve could start interest-rate cuts as soon as this month after Fed Chair Jerome Powell, asked if July was too soon to consider rate cuts, said he ""can't say"" but that the decision would depend on the economic data. Short-term interest-rate futures pointed to about a one-in-four chance of a rate cut by the Fed's July 29-30 meeting after the comments at a central banking conference in Sintra, Portugal, up from less than one-in-five from earlier. A rate cut by September is seen as virtually certain, with two more rate cuts expected by yearend, based on market pricing. (Reporting by Ann Saphir)"
US manufacturing mired in weakness as tariffs bite,2025-07-01 23:02:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-manufacturing-mired-weakness-tariffs-140243917.html,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. manufacturing remained sluggish in June, with new orders subdued and prices paid for inputs creeping higher, suggesting that the Trump administration's tariffs on imported goods continued to hamper businesses' ability to plan ahead. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Tuesday that its manufacturing PMI nudged up to 49.0 last month from a six-month low of 48.5 in May. It was the fourth straight month that the PMI was below the 50 mark, which indicates contraction in the sector that accounts for 10.2% of the economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PMI little changed at 48.8. The survey joined weak data on the housing market, consumer spending and swelling unemployment rolls that have suggested the economy's underlying momentum slowed further in the second quarter even as gross domestic product probably rebounded as the drag from a record trade deficit faded due to falling imports. A measure of domestic demand grew at its slowest pace in more than two years in the January-March quarter. President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, which have led businesses and households to front-run imports and goods purchases to avoid higher prices from duties, have muddled the economic picture. Economists warned it could take time for the tariff-related distortions to wash out of the economic data. The PMI last month was likely lifted by longer delivery times, which under normal circumstances would be related to strong demand. The extensive tariffs have caused bottlenecks in the supply chain, resulting in factories waiting longer for raw material deliveries. The ISM survey's supplier deliveries index slipped to 54.2 from 56.1 in May, though it was still high with a reading above 50 indicating slower deliveries. The ISM has reported ""ongoing delays in clearing goods through ports of entry."" The situation, however, appears to have improved slightly, with the survey's imports measure rising to a still-subdued 47.4 after slumping to 39.9 in May. Manufacturing is heavily reliant on imported raw materials. Though production at factories picked up last month, it was probably the result of manufacturers working through backlog orders. The ISM survey's forward-looking new orders sub-index dropped to 46.4 from 47.6 in May. This measure has now contracted for five consecutive months. Its gauge of prices paid by factories for inputs ticked up to 69.7 from 69.4 in the prior month. With manufacturers facing weak demand and higher prices for inputs, employment declined further last month. The survey's measure of manufacturing employment fell to 45.0 from 46.8 in May. The ISM has noted an ""acceleration of headcount reductions due to uncertain near- to mid-term demand.""

Commentary: Elon Musk is right about the Trump tax bill’s failures,2025-07-02 03:48:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/commentary-elon-musk-is-right-about-the-trump-tax-bills-failures-184821143.html,"Elon Musk’s feud with President Trump is first-rate tabloid fare. Musk’s money versus Trump’s power is a celebrity smackdown you could sell tickets to. But there’s substance behind the salacity. Musk’s principal beef with Trump is on policy. Trump is steering a giant tax bill through Congress that will cut taxes for the wealthy, reduce food and medical benefits for the poor, roll back green energy investments, subsidize fossil fuels, and add at least $4 trillion to the national debt. Musk calls the bill “insane” and is so vexed he’s vowing to fund a new political party if the Republicans who control Congress pass the legislation. The bill is insane, or at least parts of it are. Congress has to do something about tax cuts that expire at the end of this year, threatening a de facto tax hike on millions of Americans. A sensible approach would be to extend tax cuts for middle- and working-class Americans. Top earners didn’t need the tax cut when Trump first signed it into law in 2017, and they don’t need it now. It’s also time for Congress to stop racking up endless amounts of debt and shrink the giant gap between federal spending and revenue. The Republican tax bill pretends there is no debt problem, like a spending addict who can’t stop opening new credit card accounts. It enshrines culture war ideology while ignoring the green energy technology race, a key battle between China and the United States. It also literally takes from the poor to give to the rich, setting Republicans up for a possible midterm election drubbing in 2026 that could be worse than the pounding they took in 2018, when Democrats picked up 41 seats in the House of Representatives and took control of the chamber. Drop Rick Newman a note , take his weekly economy quiz , or sign up for his newsletter . While protesting its cost, the multibillionaire Tesla CEO also said on social media that the bill “will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country. It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future.” Musk is talking about the bill’s energy provisions. There are two versions of the overall bill, one the House passed in May and one the Senate passed on July 1. The two chambers must now agree on a single version that both houses can vote on. Arcane congressional procedures make it more likely the Senate version will prevail. The Senate package repeals several hundred billion dollars’ worth of tax credits for renewable energy that Congress passed in 2022, when Democrats controlled the House and Senate. Green energy is the industry of the future that Musk is talking about. The Senate bill also includes provisions favorable to the coal, oil, and natural gas industries, which are Musk’s industries of the past. Trump and many Republicans portray green energy as a liberal fever dream that can’t survive without lavish government subsidies. That ignores economic reality. China has declared green energy a strategic industry in which it seeks global dominance, with massive government subsidies for new technologies such as electric vehicle batteries and renewable energy equipment. The Biden-era green energy tax breaks were meant to match China’s approach and help American firms catch up. Renewable energy is a trillion-dollar market likely to double in size within a few years. That doesn’t mean Biden-style subsidies are necessary or appropriate, but it does mean policymakers should be careful about taking any steps that would harm American competitiveness or give China an edge. Congress isn’t doing anything like that. The bill cuts green energy only because Republicans need to find some spending cuts to lower the overall cost of the tax cuts. FILE PHOTO: Elon Musk is seen with a bruised eye that Musk claimed he received at the hands of his son, X Æ A-12, as he attends a press conference with U.S. President Donald Trump in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., May 30, 2025. REUTERS/Nathan Howard/File Photo · Reuters / Reuters There are a lot of well-paying jobs in green energy , one of the fastest-growing sectors of the economy. The leading electrical workers union has bashed the Senate bill , saying ""this bill will cost hundreds of thousands of good-paying construction jobs."" Musk retweeted that claim, an unusual alliance between a labor union and a stridently anti-union CEO. Musk has many allies in his complaint about the $4 trillion cost of the Senate tax bill . The national debt is already $36 trillion, and some economists think excessive federal borrowing is beginning to push long-term interest rates higher than they would otherwise be. That would be the “debt crisis” budget hawks have been warning about for decades. All three major rating agencies have now downgraded the US credit rating, citing political unwillingness to get annual deficits under control. Congress is once again proving how right they are. Read more: What is the US debt ceiling, and how does it impact you? Musk also says that passing the bill would be “ political suicide for the Republican Party .” He could be right about that too. All the provisions combined would actually cut net income for the poorest 40% of Americans , mainly because of cuts to food aid and healthcare programs for millions of lower-income people. Top earners would benefit the most from the bill, with the top 20% enjoying a $6,000 boost in after-tax income, according to Yale Budget Lab . The 2017 Trump tax cuts were unpopular, leading to Republican setbacks in the 2018 elections. The outcome could be more stark in 2026, given that the current bill is crueler to lower-income Americans. Musk may have a better grasp of the bill’s economic impacts than many of the politicians voting for it. But forming a new political party may not be much of a remedy. Musk’s own political instincts aren’t exactly mainstream. The “DOGE” cuts he spearheaded during his short tenure as Trump’s bureaucratic hatchet man targeted agencies such as Social Security that many voters rely on. Most voters want lower costs and higher living standards, not the sort of techno-libertarian revolution Musk envisions. We definitely need better politicians, but we could use better billionaires as well. Rick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance . Follow him on Bluesky and X : @rickjnewman.

"Taxes, energy, and healthcare: 3 ways Senate's Trump megabill impacts the business world",2025-07-02 02:12:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/taxes-energy-and-healthcare-3-ways-senates-trump-megabill-impacts-the-business-world-160535626.html,"Senate leaders advanced President Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" on Tuesday in a vote that moved the megabill one step closer to becoming law despite three Republican defections, leading to a 50-50 tally that required Vice President JD Vance to break the tie in Trump's favor. The process proved exceptionally contentious in recent days, largely over healthcare provisions that are set to extract hundreds of billions in government savings but cause millions to lose coverage. This portion of the bill fueled two of the Republican no votes — Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Susan Collins of Maine — and led to last-minute concessions to Lisa Murkowski of Alaska as a way of securing her yes vote. The third Republican no vote was Rand Paul of Kentucky, who objected to the inclusion of a $5 trillion debt ceiling increase in the package. Medicaid and that debt ceiling increase were just two pieces of a complex, nearly 900-page bill that is set to reshape whole swathes of the US economy, especially among taxes, energy, and healthcare. Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, center, is seen on Capitol Hill during final negotiations at the US Capitol on July 1. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) · Andrew Harnik via Getty Images Clean energy companies — especially electric-vehicle maker Tesla ( TSLA ) — were perhaps paying the closest attention. Government support for EVs and solar companies are set to be eliminated as tax credits phase out, but a last-minute change appeared to remove what could have been a new headwind in the form of an excise tax. Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged during final negotiations as the top business-world critic of the bill, attacking the price and how it treats clean energy. He said earlier Tuesday that the $3.3 increase in debt expected from the bill makes a ""mockery"" of his work at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Economists have likewise noted the final price tag, which could top $4 trillion, and critiqued an accounting gimmick Republicans employed to hide much of that red ink . Silicon Valley also has questions after a last-minute change stripped a closely-watched artificial intelligence provision from the bill. But a range of GOP priorities that were included — from increased funding for border enforcement to money for America's 250th anniversary celebration next year — pushed the bill over the line, with many in corporate America in favor and focused on the tax piece. The Business Roundtable, which represents CEOs in Washington, D.C., said the bill would ""send a swift, decisive signal that America will remain a premier destination for businesses to invest, hire and grow."" President Trump on Tuesday morning expressed confidence it would reach his desk soon, calling it the ""greatest bill ever passed."" The legislation now moves back to the US House of Representatives. House GOP leaders reaffirmed after the vote that their goal is to have the bill to the president’s desk by July 4th with the first step likely to happen this afternoon in the House Rules committee. That comes even as the conservative Freedom Caucus and other members sent signs they aren’t happy with the changes. One recent comment from Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, who sits on the Rules committee, read “we’ve got to deliver for the President—but it has to be the right bill.” For now, here is a closer look at three ways the current version of the bill, as blessed by the Senate, would impact the business world. Senate Majority Leader John Thune near the Senate floor on July 1. (Alex Wong/Getty Images) · Alex Wong via Getty Images Changes for both the individual and corporate tax structure A centerpiece of the bill — and far and away the source of the most expensive provisions — surrounds taxes. The bill's main impetus has long been to permanently extend tax cuts for individuals contained in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which Trump signed into law on a temporary basis during his first term as president. The bill would represent a continuation of the status quo for taxpayers. As one example, if the bill is enacted, America's highest earners will see a continued top rate of 37%. The bill also provides new tax credits for individuals by fulfilling signature Trump campaign promises — albeit slightly less fulsomely than in the House version — to eliminate taxes on tips, overtime, and car loan interest. It also offers an expanded standard deduction for seniors after Trump promised to eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits. Employees would be able to deduct up to $25,000 annually for tips and overtime in the Senate version, in contrast to the House's approach of 100% deductibility under certain income limits. Business owners, meanwhile, are keenly focused on a series of tax deductions that will reinstate credits for corporations for things like property depreciation, capital investments, new factory construction, interest expenses, and research and development costs. Many of these provisions were present in the House version, but only temporarily. Permanency was a key Senate priority and is now included in the bill, even as it increased the price tag. Senate Finance Committee chair Mike Crapo shepherded the tax changes and celebrated the passage with a statement after the vote that said corporate provisions give ""businesses the certainty they need to make the long-term investments that power economic growth."" The bill also makes permanent the pass-through deduction at a rate of 20%. That deduction — formally known as the 199A deduction — is focused on often smaller businesses organized as S corporations or partnerships. The Senate version also includes an array of other tax changes, including a $40,000 annual deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) for some taxpayers in the coming years, enhanced credits for ""opportunity zones,"" and so-called MAGA accounts . A focus on energy and healthcare The effect on the energy sector could be profound, especially after a last-minute series of changes turned the bill even further against the clean energy industry while offering new support for fossil fuels. The bill has long been expected to phase out Biden-era clean energy tax credits, but the final Senate bill now aims to shut them down faster than expected. The proposal to eliminate EV credits is immediate and would take effect on September 30 of this year. A late addition to the bill also raised worries in the form of a new tax on wind and solar projects completed after 2027 if a certain amount of supplies came from China. But those objections appear to have led to a moderation, with the final draft quietly removing that excise tax. It gave clean energy advocates some solace, with Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts posting that ""we just forced them to take it out."" President Trump speaks to the media before a trip to Florida on July 1. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) · ASSOCIATED PRESS At the same time, new last-minute inducements were unveiled for fossil fuels, including one classifying coal as a critical mineral for a government manufacturing credit. ""We're doing coal,"" Trump said in an interview released over the weekend on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" where he also called solar energy projects ""ugly as hell."" It was a mix that led Musk and others to predict that it would cut off clean energy, hurt the overall energy grid, and perhaps lead to higher utility bills. The bill is also set to implement major changes to the healthcare system. Healthcare negotiations went until nearly the literal last minute with the overall package is set to trim the government's Medicaid spending by around $900 billion in the years ahead. Corners of the sector, like rural hospitals, are set to be most directly impacted. Republican Sen. Collins of Maine explained her no vote afterwards as driven ""primarily from the harmful impact [the bill] will have on Medicaid, affecting low-income families and rural health care providers like our hospitals and nursing homes."" And the bottom line for patients — according to an accounting from the Congressional Budget Office that came in over the weekend — is that 11.8 million additional Americans would become uninsured by 2034 because of the healthcare provisions. Some that lose coverage would be illegal immigrants, as Republicans often point out, but millions of US citizens are expected to lose coverage if the bill is enacted because of additional requirements to qualify for coverage. Capitol Hill has yet to offer its final verdict on the package, with House deliberations still in the offing, but the healthcare provisions appearing to erode popular support for the package. A series of polls has shown declines as the focus has turned to healthcare. Even a recent Fox News national poll found a 21-point gap between those who say they are opposed (59%) and those who say they are in favor (38%). But Republicans are celebrating a significant win Tuesday with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent adding in his own statement ""we encourage House Republicans to act quickly.""

July 4: Gas prices to hit their lowest level since 2021,2025-07-02 00:00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/july-4-gas-prices-to-hit-their-lowest-level-since-2021-150059562.html,"Gasoline prices are on track to hit their lowest level since 2021 heading into the July Fourth holiday. On Tuesday, the national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline stood at $3.18 per gallon, according to AAA data . This marks a $0.31 drop compared to the same day last year. Cheaper gas is a welcome relief for the more than 61 million people expected to hit the road this weekend. ""Americans will spend ~$500 million less on gasoline this July 4 weekend (Thu-Sun) vs last year,"" GasBuddy head of petroleum analysis Patrick De Haan wrote on X. The drop in gas prices has been largely driven by lower prices for oil ( CL=F , BZ=F ) following President Trump's announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. That eased concerns about a potential supply shock . Read more: Is the stock market open on July Fourth? Despite relief at the pump, the next one or two months may be bumpy, according to Turner, Mason & Co. chief market analyst Tom Kloza. ""We may wobble a bit higher or lower in July and August,"" he said. ""Demand is decent and there are enough issues with US refining to keep the market supported in these peak summer months."" Kloza noted a wide disparity in prices across the country. Drivers in the Southeast and Great Lakes regions may find gas for under $2.50 per gallon, while California continues to post the highest prices nationwide. The Golden State's elevated prices are due to a combination of special fuel blend requirements, higher taxes and fees aimed at curbing emissions, and an expected shutdown of two major refineries, which could send prices even higher. Still, at $4.58 per gallon, prices in California have eased about $0.21 compared to this time last year. Read more: What are the best credit cards for gas? Energy analysts see prices falling below $3 per gallon later this year as the driving season winds down and refineries switch to less expensive winter blends. However, weather remains a wild card — as does the Middle East. Hurricane season is just beginning, and any major storms in the Gulf of Mexico could send prices climbing again. ""As long as tensions in the Middle East remain contained and the U.S. avoids a major hurricane, we could see the national average fall below $3 per gallon later this summer,"" GasBuddy's De Haan said.

Job openings hit highest level since November 2024,2025-07-01 23:55:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/job-openings-hit-highest-level-since-november-2024-144025969.html,"Job openings unexpectedly rose in May to hit the highest level since November 2024, according to government data released Tuesday. The report comes as investors closely watch for any signs of slowing in the labor market amid a debate over when the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates again. New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed 7.76 million jobs open at the end of May, an increase from the 7.39 million seen the month prior. The April figure was revised higher by 4,000 openings. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected Tuesday's report to show 7.3 million openings in May. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) also showed that 5.5 million hires were made during the month, down from the 5.61 million made during April. The hiring rate ticked lower to 3.4% from the 3.5%. In one sign that workers remain cautious about labor market conditions, the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, moved up to 2.1% from 2% in April. Still, both the hiring and quits rates are hovering near decade lows, reflecting what economists have described as a labor market in ""stasis."" ""Hiring remains depressed, but that is less worrisome than it would be otherwise because layoffs continue to be low,"" Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten wrote in a note to clients. The latest JOLTS data comes as investors continue to watch economic data for any signs of impact from President Trump's tariffs. In May, the labor market showed some signs of cooling with the US labor market adding 139,000 jobs while the unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%. Tuesday's data comes ahead of another update on the labor market expected for release on Thursday morning. Consensus expects the June jobs report to show hiring slowed further, with nonfarm payroll additions projected to fall to 110,000 and the unemployment rate expected to tick higher to 4.3%.

Powell isn't taking a July rate cut off the table for Fed,2025-07-01 23:38:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/powell-isnt-taking-a-july-rate-cut-off-the-table-for-fed-142021668.html,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell didn’t rule out an interest rate reduction this month but agreed that the central bank would have cut rates by now if not for the tariffs introduced by the Trump administration. ""I wouldn't take any meeting off the table or put it directly on the table,"" Powell said on a panel at a European Central Bank monetary policy conference in Portugal, when asked about the possibility of a cut in July. ""It's going to depend on how the data evolved."" Powell noted a “solid majority” of the Fed’s interest rate setting committee do expect that it will become appropriate later this year to begin to lower rates again, explicitly mentioning the remaining four meetings of the year. That includes a gathering on July 29-30. He was also asked by the panel moderator if the US central bank would have cut more by now if not for tariffs. The Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point in 2024 but has held rates steady so far in 2025. “So I do think that — I think that's right,” he said, noting that “we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs.” Read more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell listens during an open meeting of the Fed Board of Governors on June 25. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) · ASSOCIATED PRESS “We think the prudent thing to do is to wait and learn more and see what those effects might be.” Powell reiterated that the Fed has not seen much effect yet from tariffs, noting that the central bank expects to see some “higher readings” on inflation but that officials are prepared to learn and that inflation could be higher, lower, later, or sooner than expected. His comments come as the chairman and the Fed face intensifying pressure from President Trump to lower rates. On Monday, Trump used Truth Social to publish a note the president sent to Powell that showed a list of the central banks around the world with lower interest rates than the US. ""Jerome — You are, as usual, 'Too Late',"" the note from Trump read, telling Powell that he has ""cost the USA a fortune"" and urging him to ""lower The Rate — by a lot!""

When asked Tuesday on stage in Portugal if Trump's attacks made it more difficult for Powell to do his job, he said, ""I'm very focused on just doing my job"" and added that ""the things that matter are using our tools to achieve the goals that Congress has given us — maximum employment, price stability, financial stability — and that's what we focus on 100%."" Powell’s response was met with applause from other participants on the panel and the audience in the room. European Central Bank head Christine Lagarde was then asked if she would do the same thing if she were in the same position. ""I think I speak for my colleagues on this panel when I say I would do exactly the same thing that Jay Powell does,"" Lagarde said. Powell has roughly 10 months left in his term as chair. He said on Tuesday, “I want to hand over to my successor an economy in good shape. That’s what keeps me awake at night.” He was also asked if he would serve out his term as a Fed governor until 2028. “I have nothing for you on that today."" he said.

Why Wall Street's biggest Tesla bear still hates the stock,2025-07-01 22:12:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-wall-streets-biggest-tesla-bear-still-hates-the-stock-131256775.html,"Tesla ( TSLA ) stock sank Tuesday morning as Elon Musk again traded blows with President Trump while a bearish JPMorgan note warned of potentially weak second quarter deliveries. JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman reiterated his $115 price target on the stock — the lowest among major analysts and roughly 65% below Tesla's current trading levels, according to Yahoo Finance data . Tesla shares closed Friday at around $323. ""Based on our checks, the softer demand for Tesla vehicles evident in 1Q results appears to have continued into 2Q,"" Brinkman wrote. The analyst cited ongoing weakness in Europe, slowing momentum in China, and the potential early expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit as near-term risks. Tesla stock is down 6% on Tuesday and 16% year to date. NasdaqGS - Delayed Quote • USD (TSLA) Follow View Quote Details 317.66 - (-1.89%) At close: June 30 at 4:00:01 PM EDT Advanced Chart Read more about Tesla's stock moves and today's market action. Brinkman slashed his delivery and earnings estimates. He now expects Tesla to deliver just 360,000 vehicles in Q2, down from his prior estimate of 395,000 and well below Bloomberg's consensus of 392,000. That would represent a 19% year-over-year decline. Even with the cheaper models expected later this year, Brinkman warned that early-stage production would likely limit any volume upside. He also trimmed his Q2 earnings-per-share forecast to $0.42 from $0.48, below consensus expectations of $0.45. Full-year 2025 EPS is now pegged at $1.75, down from $2.07 and under the Street's $1.87 estimate. JPMorgan's new estimate aligns with a broader multiquarter downtrend in EPS estimates, per Yahoo Finance data . Brinkman also flagged the risk that full-year delivery projections, which assume a sharp second-half rebound, are overly optimistic. Tesla would need to deliver 922,000 vehicles in the second half of 2025 to hit consensus estimates, a 32% jump from the first half. During Q1, Tesla delivered just 336,681 vehicles, its worst showing since Q2 2022. The decline reflects persistent weakness in key markets. New car sales in Europe, for example, have fallen for five consecutive months, dropping nearly 28% year over year in May. Read more: How to avoid Tesla car insurance sticker shock Deutsche Bank offered a more tempered view. The firm now expects Q2 deliveries to come in at 355,000, down from a prior 385,000 estimate. ""We expect Tesla's 2Q25 deliveries to miss ... but this shouldn't come as a surprise,"" Deutsche Bank analysts wrote. They cited steep declines in Europe due to brand damage and rising competition, flattish results in China, and modest sequential growth in North America, helped by the Model Y Juniper ramp-up. The firm reiterated a Buy rating with a $345 price target. Meanwhile, Tesla is pushing ahead with its long-promised robotaxi program. Piper Sandler recently said the company was the best-positioned automaker in the autonomous race, though it's far from being the only one looking to make industrywide disruptions . Both notes come as Tesla contends with renewed attention on Elon Musk's political affiliations and his recent criticism of President Trump. Once considered close allies, Musk has now taken aim at Trump's domestic ""big, beautiful bill,"" even suggesting he might form a new political party. Some investors fear the escalating rhetoric could further polarize the brand. The company is expected to release Q2 delivery figures after the bell later this month .

Tesla stock sinks as Trump threatens to cut subsidies across Musk's sprawling empire,2025-07-02 05:02:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-sinks-as-trump-threatens-to-cut-subsidies-across-musks-sprawling-empire-124419378.html,"Tesla stock ( TSLA ) sank 5% Tuesday as the feud between CEO Elon Musk and President Trump reignited , with the president once again threatening to cut government subsidies across Elon Musk's businesses, including Tesla and SpaceX ( SPAX.PVT ). ""Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa,"" Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social, early Tuesday. ""No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE,"" Trump added. ""Perhaps we should have DOGE take a good, hard, look at this? BIG MONEY TO BE SAVED!!!"" Read more about Tesla's stock moves and today's market action. The threats followed Musk’s criticism of Trump’s ""big, beautiful"" tax and spending bill over the weekend after the Senate advanced it with last-minute changes that would eliminate electric vehicle tax credits — which benefit Tesla customers — earlier than expected and add $1 trillion to the bill’s original price tag . The megabill was passed by the Senate on Tuesday, bringing it one step closer to becoming law. Its provision ending the EV credit would cut an estimated $1.2 billion from Tesla's annual profit. Meanwhile, SpaceX has received more than $21 billion in federal contracts, according to US spending data. In one of his series of posts on his own platform, X, Musk called the bill ""utterly insane and destructive [with] handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future."" Musk’s critiques continued into the trading week, with the tech mogul proposing the formation of a new political party for the second time last month. Tesla shares dropped 1.9% Monday as the Senate began voting on amendments to the bill in what’s called a vote-a-rama , which dragged into Tuesday morning. Late Monday night, Musk posted an AI-generated image of Pinocchio with the word “liar” stamped across it, writing: “Anyone who campaigned on the PROMISE of REDUCING SPENDING , but continues to vote on the BIGGEST DEBT ceiling increase in HISTORY will see their face on this poster in the primary next year.” Elon Musk in the Oval Office at the White House in May. (AP Foto/Evan Vucci) · ASSOCIATED PRESS Trump’s Truth Social post threatening subsidies on Musk’s empire followed just a few hours later. “Elon Musk knew, long before he so strongly Endorsed me for President, that I was strongly against the EV Mandate,” the president wrote. The barbs revived a feud between the world’s two most powerful men in early June that erased more than $150 billion in value from Tesla in a single day. Those exchanges last month saw Trump and Musk trade a wide array of insults on social media, exposing the risk of the electric vehicle stock's ""Musk premium."" Musk has been highly critical of Trump’s ""big, beautiful"" bill since he left his role in D.C. running the newly created federal agency DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency, which aimed but ultimately failed to eliminate government debt with highly controversial spending cuts. “The jabs between Musk and Trump will continue as the Budget rolls through Congress but Tesla investors want Musk to focus on driving Tesla and stop this political angle ... which has turned into a life of its own in a roller coaster ride since the November elections,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients Tuesday morning. “At the end of the day being on Trump's bad side will not turn out well ... and Musk knows this and Tesla investors want this back and forth to end,” Ives wrote. Also driving Tesla shares down Tuesday, fresh data showed Tesla’s sales dropped for the sixth straight month in Sweden and Denmark in June.

Trump slams Elon Musk as feud reignites before Senate vote,2025-07-02 00:09:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-slams-elon-musk-as-feud-reignites-before-senate-vote-114100932.html,"President Trump slammed Elon Musk's subsidies, and Republican senators struck down a plan to shield artificial intelligence from state regulations. These two middle-of-the-night developments on Tuesday reinforced a growing schism between Trump and Silicon Valley supporters ahead of the vote on his ""big, beautiful bill."" The first development came at 12:44 a.m. ET, when Trump responded to Tesla ( TSLA ) CEO Musk's ongoing critiques of the package, focusing on the government grants that Musk's companies receive. ""Without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa,"" wrote the president in a Truth Social post , adding, ""perhaps we should have DOGE take a good, hard, look at this?"" The president was referring to the government efficiency group that Musk ran until recently. The president's missive came after Trump's signature legislation underwent key changes in recent days that set off many in the tech industry, Musk most of all, with new measures to tax green energy companies and further support for fossil fuels , as well as a growing price tag. Elon Musk and President Trump appeared together during a news conference in the Oval Office on Musk's last day as a 'special government employee' on May 30. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) · ASSOCIATED PRESS The divide between many in Silicon Valley and the ""big, beautiful bill"" has been evident for over a month . It appeared set to deepen further when, a few hours later, a closely watched artificial intelligence provision was stripped from the bill itself. This plan, which had many Silicon Valley supporters, was meant to shield the quickly growing AI industry from state and local regulations. But the idea now appears to be dead after Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee turned against a compromise plan Monday evening and stripped it from the bill. It wasn't close in the end, with the Senate voting 99-1 to adopt Blackburn's subsequent amendment in a count that wrapped up a little after 4:00 a.m. ET. Trump's overall package also appears to be teetering Tuesday morning after a series of overnight developments saw two key Republican senators — Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine — uncommitted to vote yes. Those two senators could join two Republicans already committed to voting no, which would be enough to sink the package. Promises from Musk to challenge Republican lawmakers The drama between the president and the world's richest man has been up and down for weeks, but it escalated Monday afternoon when Musk offered new electoral threats against Republicans. Musk had already amplified Democrats' critiques and talked about the need for a new political party. He offered a striking promise Monday afternoon that lawmakers who vote for the bill ""will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth."" Musk, of course, was the biggest donor during the 2024 campaign, spending at least $288 million, most of which was offered in support of Trump. Trump reiterated his critiques of Musk Tuesday morning, speaking to reporters and saying of Musk's objection to losing EV subsidies, ""Elon can lose a lot more than that."" The president also called the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) a ""monster that might have to go back and eat Elon."" And when asked by a reporter if he would consider deporting Musk, he demurred: ""We'll have to take a look."" What is unclear for the days ahead is how much the Trump-Musk fight will impact the actual chances of the bill's passage, with Senate amendment votes ongoing. Musk is clearly focused on a debate likely coming later this week, when the House is set to take up the amended measure if it passes. The House is where a vocal bloc of fiscal conservatives — who often vote as part of the ""Freedom Caucus"" — warily supported a previous version of the bill, saying a previous smaller price tag was too big. Musk even tagged some of these House Republican lawmakers in some of his latest posts, which continued throughout the night with dozens of messages. Musk also responded to Trump's comments about his subsidies by saying his companies like Tesla and SpaceX ( SPAX.PVT ) would be fine and that oil and gas subsidies should be removed as well. Elon Musk met with Senate Republicans at the US Capitol in March. (Graeme Sloan for the Washington Post via Getty Images) · The Washington Post via Getty Images Critiques of the AI idea as a 'violation of state rights' The back-and-forth over AI also came to a head overnight after the House passed a plan in May that included a complete ban on state regulations of AI for a decade. The little-noticed measure gained wider attention in the weeks that followed, with many of Trump's most loyal supporters opposing it. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene even admitted that she hadn't been aware of the provision when she voted yes. The Georgia lawmaker then announced her opposition and plans to vote no if this ""violation of state rights"" stayed in the bill. Trump himself doesn't appear to have taken a position on the measure, but it had the backing of his Silicon Valley-aligned aides, most notably the vocal support of AI and crypto czar (and longtime venture capitalist) David Sacks. But Republican opposition grew, and Sen. Blackburn of Tennessee became a leading voice of opposition in the Senate. She entered into negotiations over the issue and appeared to have found a compromise in recent days around the idea that instead of a decade-long ban, the provision would be amended to be a ""temporary pause"" of five years. States would be strongly discouraged from regulating AI, as lawmakers linked it to access to millions of dollars in AI infrastructure and deployment funding. But even that wasn't enough. Blackburn renounced the compromise, said a moratorium ""could allow Big Tech to continue to exploit kids, creators, and conservatives,"" and teamed with a top Democrat to strike the provision entirely. Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders (a former Trump press secretary) congratulated Blackburn on the move in a post the senator quickly reposted. ""This is how you take on big tech!"" Sanders wrote.

"How Boeing, Walmart, and Tesla tell the stock story of 2025",2025-07-01 19:00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-boeing-walmart-and-tesla-tell-the-stock-story-of-2025-100046482.html,"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings Three themes tell the story of the year so far, embodied by three stocks that encapsulate the highs and the lows of the first half of 2025. Boeing ( BA ) has become the government's favorite trade talk tool, representing resilience and preferential treatment from D.C. Walmart ( WMT ) captures the other side of the tariff challenge, warning of price increases and omitting some guidance as the outlook remains uncertain. And thirdly, the volatility around Tesla ( TSLA ), and by extension its CEO and former government employee, Elon Musk, reflects the chaos of the last several months and the shifting policies and alliances that have driven the market. Boeing has emerged as a clear winner in the first six months of this year's trading after spending most of its recent memory marred by a series of high-profile blunders. But the stock is riding the momentum of several trade deals , becoming an instrument of US statecraft. The Trump administration has wielded contracts with the aerospace manufacturer like a bargaining chip, reinforcing the company's importance as a marquee ticker and a symbol of American might. Shares are up 20% for the year, and have even recouped the losses following the Air India crash of a Boeing 787 on June 12. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Morning Brief Subscribe By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy While not featured in trade talk deals the way Boeing has been, another name stands out for rising on shifting political winds, expanded government work, and AI excitement: Palantir ( PLTR ). The best performer in the S&P 500 last year, it's a stock that has long been at the top of trending charts . Palantir shares are up more than 80% so far this year as the administration seeks to use the company's security and defense technology for data analysis. But for every Palantir and Boeing there are dozens more tickers (and many more private companies) that are being squeezed by tariffs and the prospects of more to come. Read more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, reported mixed numbers in its first quarter report , noting that tariffs had already led to price increases in April and May. While executives said they expect net sales for the second quarter to increase as much as 4.5%, they did not provide guidance for adjusted earnings or operating income for the second quarter. The absence of full guidance underscored a broader challenge for corporations across the country: coping with the consequences of tariff policy without knowing their full scope and their ultimate impact. Still, Walmart has gained about 7% this year, slightly ahead of the benchmark S&P's 5% increase. Getting a handle on 2025's unpredictability wouldn't be possible without also reflecting on the losses. And that's where Tesla comes in. The company's mercurial stock chart highlights the exuberance that defined the start of the year, only to be followed by tariff anxiety, the tug-of-war between bulls and bears, and the falling out between Musk and Trump. The push in Washington to advance the administration's signature legislation , with key implications for the clean energy industry, once again brought their disagreements center stage. Musk issued a series of weekend posts calling the bill ""utterly insane and destructive [with] handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future."" Earlier this month, their public feuding led to the loss of $150 billion of Tesla’s value. Meanwhile, Tesla's ambitions to build a nationwide fleet of robotaxis were met with renewed enthusiasm after a launch event last week. Perhaps investors cheering a fairly mediocre launch of a handful of scofflaw robotaxis is the best encapsulation of the past six months, illustrating the market's singular ability to play down a regrettable present and look forward.

"Stock market today: S&P 500, Nasdaq jump to fresh records, capping stunning second-quarter comeback",2025-07-01 05:23:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-sp-500-nasdaq-jump-to-fresh-records-capping-stunning-second-quarter-comeback-201100983.html,"US stocks climbed to fresh records on Monday amid signs of progress in trade talks, ending one of the most volatile first halves of a year in recent memory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) rose over 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) and the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) moved up about 0.5%, with both indices notching new record highs as the benchmark index closed above 6,200 for the first time. Big Tech giants Nvidia ( NVDA ) and Meta ( META ) hit their own fresh records. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite last week had clinched new record highs for the first time since February — the start of the year's tariff-fueled stock swings. Stocks started a holiday-shortened week on an upbeat note as hopes rose that the US and its top trading partners are closing in on deals over the sweeping tariffs introduced by President Trump. Canada scrapped a digital services tax targeting US tech companies late on Sunday — just hours before it was set to start collecting payments — in a bid to revive stalled trade negotiations. The easing in odds of a global trade war comes as a July 9 deadline looms for the resumption of sweeping US ""reciprocal"" tariffs, which Trump on Sunday said he didn't think he'd need to extend. So far, his administration has hammered out only two accords — not full-blown agreements — with China and the UK, with the British tariff deal going into effect on Monday. Trump tariffs: Read the latest here Market watchers were closely following Senate negotiations over Trump’s proposed $4.5 trillion tax cut bill , as Republican leaders race to persuade party holdouts to back the legislation. The Congressional Budget Office estimated it would add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over a decade, as it stands. The Senate was voting on dozens of amendments in a marathon session on Monday. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield ( ^TNX ) fell about 5 basis points to 4.23%. Looking ahead, the June jobs report on Thursday will be a highlight , as markets increasingly grow optimistic that the Federal Reserve could lower interest rates soon. But the week's trading will be cut short, as markets will close at 1 p.m. ET on Thursday , and remain shut on Friday for the Fourth of July holiday.

Those gains come after the two indexes hit new highs last week for the first time since February. The tech-heavy Nasdaq moved up as Nvidia ( NVDA ) and Meta ( META ) notched their own record closing highs. Microsoft ( MSFT ) touched an intraday high but ended the day nose hairs short of a new record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) climbed 0.6% but was still clawing its way back toward its prior record close in December. The 10-year Treasury yield ( ^TNX ) fell 5 basis points as investors closely watched the advancement of Trump's ""big, beautiful bill"" through the Senate.

Mon, June 30, 2025 at 6:00 PM UTC Myles Udland Trump sent Jay Powell a signed chart calling for the Fed to lower interest rates: 'You have cost the USA a fortune' President Trump broke new ground in his ongoing calls for Fed Chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates — the president sent a signed note to the Fed chair. In a post on Truth Social , the social network owned by Trump, the president again called for Powell and the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, writing that Powell and the Fed's Board of Governors ""should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this to happen to the United States."" Trump added that the Fed should cut rates to 1%. Earlier this month, the Fed kept its benchmark interest rate in a range of 4.25%-4.5% . Trump's post included a signed picture of global central bank interest rates that showed the nearly three dozen global central banks that have set benchmark rates below the Fed. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed in a press conference Monday that this signed table was sent to Powell. Trump's latest barbs at Powell come as speculation over who will replace Powell as Fed chair next year continues to heat up. During an interview on Bloomberg earlier on Monday , Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested there are people already at the Fed being considered to take Powell's role as chair. Bessent added that there are other strategies Trump could pursue, such as filling the open seat on the Fed's Board of Governors, that could exert pressure on Powell before his term as chair is up next May. As Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger has reported , former Fed government Kevin Warsh, current Fed governor Christoper Waller, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, former World Bank president David Malpass, and Bessent are candidates that have been discussed to replace Powell, according to people close to the administration.

The stock traded flat on Monday at around $178 per share and is down more than 6% for the year, underperforming its “Magnificent Seven” peers. Slowinski also wrote: “In addition, business model transition risks may weigh on top line Search Advertising growth as Google sees fewer Search clicks, and explores new monetisation approaches like AI Overviews, AI Mode, Live Search and the Gemini Assistant.” Mon, June 30, 2025 at 4:30 PM UTC Ines Ferré Meta on pace to close at record high as social media giant leans into AI, outperforms 'Mag 7' stocks Meta ( META ) stock was on pace to close at a record high on Monday for the first time since February.

Mon, June 30, 2025 at 3:20 PM UTC Laura Bratton Nvidia remains top pick at Morgan Stanley despite skepticism over supply chain bottlenecks Morgan Stanley ( MS ) analysts wrote in a note to clients Sunday that they are bullish on Nvidia ( NVDA ) stock and ""looking through"" concerns over bottlenecks in its supply chain that could lead the chipmaker to produce GPUs faster than its suppliers can build them into server racks. After meeting with industry contacts in Taiwan and Beijing, analyst Joseph Moore wrote that Nvidia's supply chain is ""strong near term"" but ""mixed longer term."" ""Near-term data points from several supply chain participants suggest strength in AI, but significant skepticism about 2026 remains,"" Moore wrote. ""That skepticism is driven by the same concerns we hear about from US investors — chip production ahead of various supply bottlenecks will lead to excess inventory by year end."" ""The reason we are looking through these concerns is that our contacts point to very strong demand for all Blackwell form factors, and supply bottlenecks across racks and power management easing materially,"" the analyst added. Moore said Nvidia is his top pick of chip stocks. The Financial Times reported in late May that Nvidia's suppliers had resolved technical issues that had delayed shipments of its Blackwell AI servers and threatened the chipmaker's annual sales targets. Nvidia stock last week notched a new record high. Shares fell fractionally Monday morning. Mon, June 30, 2025 at 2:42 PM UTC Laura Bratton HPE stock rises after settling DOJ antitrust case Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock ( HPE ) jumped more than 13% Monday morning following news over the weekend that the company had settled a case with the US Department of Justice. The DOJ sued HPE — one of the largest makers of wireless networking systems — in January to block the company's proposed $14 billion acquisition of another company in the industry, Juniper Networks ( JNPR ). Juniper Networks shares were up 8% early Monday. The settlement ""paves the way to close HPE’s acquisition of Juniper Networks,"" HPE CEO Antonio Neri said in a statement Saturday. Juniper has a ""strong position"" in the artificial intelligence space, Bank of America's Wamsi Mohan wrote in a note to clients Monday. With the acquisition of Juniper, HPE is ""positioned to offer an end-to-end networking and AI infrastructure stack that can better compete in AI-enabled datacenter and cloud-edge environment,"" boosting the company's earnings over the long term. Mon, June 30, 2025 at 2:07 PM UTC Laura Bratton Stocks open higher with fresh records in sight Stocks moved higher at the market open Monday to start a holiday-shortened week , set to notch fresh records amid rising hopes for US trade deals ahead of the July 9 deadline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) rose roughly 0.5%. The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) moved up about 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) jumped about 0.4%. Mon, June 30, 2025 at 1:26 PM UTC Laura Bratton Oracle stock surges after disclosing 'multiple large cloud services agreements,' set to notch new intraday high Oracle stock soared more than 7% and was set to start the trading session at a new intraday high after the software giant disclosed in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had signed new cloud services agreements. “Oracle is off to a strong start in FY26,"" CEO Safra Catz will tell other Oracle colleagues later today, according to the filing . ""Our MultiCloud database revenue continues to grow at over 100%, and we signed multiple large cloud services agreements including one that is expected to contribute more than $30 billion in annual revenue starting in FY28."" In its fiscal year 2025, which ended May 31, Oracle's revenue was $57.4 billion. The company partnered with OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) and SoftBank ( SFTBY ) to launch the highly publicized $500 billion Stargate project, building AI data centers earlier this year, but the project has stalled . Mon, June 30, 2025 at 12:53 PM UTC Grace O'Donnell Solar stocks mixed on surprise Senate renewables tax Solar stocks fluctuated in premarket trading Monday after it emerged that the Senate's draft version of the tax and spending bill, which slashes wind and solar tax credits , also now contains a tax on wind and solar projects completed after 2027 that use components from China. The tax on renewable projects came as a surprise to the industry, which largely relies on China to source components from batteries to solar panels. A statement from the American Clean Power Association said the effect would be to ""strand hundreds of billions of dollars in current investments."" The latest provision comes after solar stocks were hit two weeks ago when lawmakers moved to phase out tax breaks for the industry sooner than expected. Shares of NextEra Energy ( NEE ) dropped 4% while Enphase Energy ( ENPH ) stock fell 2.6%. The Invesco Solar ETF ( TAN ) declined 1.5%. However, there were some bright spots for certain renewable stocks. US-based First Solar ( FSLR ) rose 7%, while GE Vernova ( GEV ), which offers wind technologies, added 1.1%. And Sunrun ( RUN ) gained 7% while SolarEdge Technologies ( SEDG ) advanced 0.5% due to a short-term extension of residential solar tax credits. Read more here.

A chaotic 6 months for stocks shows investors are still leaning 'bullish' headed into the second half of 2025,2025-07-01 04:10:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/a-chaotic-6-months-for-stocks-shows-investors-are-still-leaning-bullish-headed-into-the-second-half-of-2025-191024372.html,"The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) rode a bumpy path to end the first half of 2025 at a record high. After falling more than 19% in April from its previous all-time high, the benchmark index ripped to new records just two months later as the market's worst fears about the impact of President Trump's tariffs evaporated. Still, it hasn't been a clean run higher for the benchmark index. Fears over AI competition from China , tariffs' impact on the growth outlook for American corporates, and increasing tensions in the Middle East have all tested the market's chug to new records. Overall, stocks have largely shrugged off such concerns, with investors continuing to buy the dips and bid them higher. ""The market still does tend to have a bullish sentiment to it,"" Charles Schwab head of trading and derivatives strategist Joe Mazzola said in an interview. ""So I think you're seeing investors looking for those opportunities on pullbacks to buy in."" There was perhaps no better evidence of market resilience than Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcement on April 2. The S&P 500 fell more than 10% in three days, with the rout ranking just below the top 10 worst sell-offs since World War II. But in roughly a month, the benchmark index was back above levels seen before the announcement as markets cheered Trump's various tariff delays. A large part of inflows back into stocks came from retail investors, including a record $3 billion in net purchases on April 3 , per VandaTrack Research's data that dates back to 2014. ""[There's a] certain feeling of invincibility that's crept into the mindset of a lot of traders, a lot of active investors,"" Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick said in an interview on June 16. ""And it's understandable, because why wouldn't you? I mean every dip ... can be considered a buying opportunity."" The S&P 500 closed at a new record last week, marking a stunning comeback for stocks after a 10% drop in three days following President Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcement on April 2. (Photo by Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto via Getty Images) · NurPhoto via Getty Images And now with the market back at record highs, many on Wall Street have argued for stocks to keep moving higher by the end of the year. Fundstrat global head of technical strategy Mark Newton pointed out to Yahoo Finance that many money managers are benchmarked to large indexes like the S&P 500. With those indexes rebounding back to record highs, there is building pressure to outperform the market and ""play catch-up,"" per Newton. ""They all want to earn bonuses at the end of the year,"" Newton said. ""They want to make sure they're keeping track with the S&P."" At the end of the day, the key for investors is always how any headwind will impact the economy and the outlook for corporate profits, Newton said. While those estimates fell alongside stock prices earlier this year, the growth outlook for both metrics has increased alongside the recent rally in stocks. ""Equity markets have been resilient since bottoming in April, and the rally has been more fundamentally-driven than many appreciate,"" Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson, who holds a 6,500 year-end target for the S&P 500 in 2025, wrote in a note to clients on Sunday. ""While there could be some consolidation during [the third quarter], we remain bullish on a 6-12 month horizon as [earnings per share] tailwinds expand, and the market has line of sight to Fed cuts.""

Commentary: Trump is acting like the economy's in distress,2025-07-01 18:14:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/commentary-trump-is-acting-like-the-economys-in-distress-190950703.html,"President Trump wants the Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates all the way to 1% . That’s something the Fed would typically do only in an emergency situation, such as a sudden recession or financial panic. What is Trump so worried about? Short-term rates are currently at about 4.25%. The historical average is 4.6%. The Fed moves rates up or down to manage inflation and keep the economy healthy. It has signaled that it may lower rates to around 3.5% during the next year or so if inflation eases. But Trump’s own tariffs are standing in the way. By putting new taxes on roughly $3 billion worth of imports, Trump is raising costs on businesses and consumers. Most economists think the tariffs will push inflation up by a percentage point or so, from 2.4% now to 3.5% or a little higher. Read more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet Trump doesn’t seem to care about inflation , even though he ran for president last year promising to “ bring prices way down .” He’s been hectoring the Fed and its chair, Jerome Powell, to cut rates for months, first by one point, then by two, and now by more than three. “Right on track to demand negative interest rates somewhere after July 4,” Jim Bianco of Bianco Research quipped recently on social media . The Fed cuts rates when it feels inflation is under control and the economy might need a little bit of juice. Lower rates make borrowing cheaper, stimulating spending and investment. In normal times, the Fed cuts gradually, by a quarter-point once every couple of months. But it can cut aggressively when needed. During the Great Recession from 2007 to 2009, the Fed cut rates by nearly 5 points in 15 months. After the COVID pandemic erupted in 2020 and there was a sudden recession, the Fed cut by 1.5 points in two months. Anything more than a quarter-point cut usually signals that something is wrong. Trump wants a rate cut of recessionary proportions. Somebody must be telling him we have a problem, Houston. Trump’s economic advisers, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and White House economist Kevin Hassett, are publicly bullish on the economy. That’s their job. But they probably have the same concerns many economists and investors have: The economy seems to be slowing, the job market is weakening, the national debt is growing unsustainably large, and, yes, the Trump tariffs will cause more harm than good. One cause Trump has championed during both presidential terms is lower rates to make federal borrowing cheaper . Trump regularly talks about “refinancing” the government’s debt, something he practiced frequently as a real estate developer operating with borrowed money. President Donald Trump speaks to the media, Friday, June 27, 2025, in the briefing room of the White House in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) · ASSOCIATED PRESS Drop Rick Newman a note , take his weekly economy quiz , or sign up for his newsletter . Relatively low rates during recent years brought the average rate the government pays on all of its debt from 5% in 2007 to just 1.6% in 2022. The government benefited, like all other borrowers, from those aggressive Fed rate cuts in 2020. But the government's average borrowing rate has since jumped back to 3.3% at the same time federal deficits have swelled to nearly $2 trillion per year. Annual interest payments on the debt now top $1 trillion, the second-largest federal spending category after Social Security. Trump is no budget hawk. The tax-cut bill he’s pushing through Congress will add another $4 trillion or so to the national debt , which is certain to top $40 trillion by the end of the decade. But Trump ought to know that some president soon is going to have to deal with the ramifications of a gigantic national debt, and it might end up being him . On Tuesday, Trump posted on Truth Social : ""Republicans, the One Big Beautiful Bill, perhaps the greatest and most important of its kind in history, gives the largest Tax Cuts and Border Security ever, Jobs by the Millions, Military/Vets increases, and so much more. The failure to pass means a whopping 68% Tax increase, the largest in history!!!"" Already, there are signs the unprecedented gusher of federal debt is rattling financial markets. All three major ratings agencies have now downgraded the US credit rating . Long-term interest rates have been higher this year than they ought to be, which is exactly what happens when there’s more debt than markets can absorb. That’s contributing to a weakening dollar and a “ sell America” trade in which foreign assets start to look more attractive than American ones. If Trump got his way, sharply lower rates would obviously reduce the government’s borrowing costs. But it wouldn’t do anything to solve the underlying problems, which are too much debt in the first place and a spendthrift Congress that won’t do anything about it. Trump may also be worried about the slowing economy, which turned in negative GDP growth in the first quarter. Job openings are trending lower , consumer confidence stinks (as usual), and Americans are increasingly worried about the labor market . If the economy is truly weakening, the Fed will undoubtedly cut rates at some point. Just not as much as Trump wants. Read more: How the Fed rate decision affects your bank accounts, loans, credit cards, and investments Banking analyst Chris Whalen thinks the Fed could ultimately cut short-term rates from 4.25% now to 3%. But he also thinks long-term rates on mortgages and other consumer and business loans are likely to go up rather than down because of all the additional deficit spending coming in Trump’s tax-cut bill. That could be a stagflation scenario in which growth stalls but inflation and interest rates stay unusually high, which would make voters even surlier. There’s probably one other reason for Trump’s radical interest rate stance. Trump has attacked Powell so frequently — calling him “ numbskull ,” “ dummy ,” and “ stubborn mule ,” among other things — that it’s obvious Trump is teeing up a villain he can blame if something goes wrong. If inflation does spike, or unemployment rises, or consumers simply remain grim, Trump can say that it’s all Powell’s fault for waiting too long to cut rates and that the Fed chair should have listened to the much smarter president. Most economists think the Fed’s short-term rates are about where they should be, for now. Virtually nobody is forecasting the kind of doom that would justify urgent, dramatic rate cuts. And there’s broad confidence that the Fed will cut rates if a weaker economy calls for it. Just not at the White House. Rick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance .

"Tesla Q2 deliveries expected to disappoint as Musk focuses on AI, robotaxi efforts",2025-07-01 18:07:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-q2-deliveries-expected-to-disappoint-as-musk-focuses-on-ai-robotaxi-efforts-181452072.html,"Tesla ( TSLA ) is expected to report another tough quarter when it comes to electric vehicle deliveries. Investors are hoping the bigger story remains its burgeoning robotaxi tests. For the second quarter, Tesla is expected to report global deliveries of 395,328, per Bloomberg consensus estimates, down 11% compared to a year ago but significantly higher than the 336,700 delivered in Q1. Production across its global plants is expected to come in at 443,321, up compared to last year’s 410,800 produced. Sliding deliveries in the second quarter come as the company ramps up sales of its refreshed Model Y SUV, the company’s top seller, which was expected to boost sales. Disappointing Q2 sales for Tesla are not exactly a surprise for investors and analysts following the company. Tesla EV registrations (a proxy for sales) in Europe fell 27.9% in May compared to a year ago, per the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA). Meanwhile, overall EV registrations in the region, which includes the UK and the European Free Trade Association, rose 25% in May, with overall registrations down 0.6%. May's total marks the fifth straight month of declining Tesla sales in the European region. Tesla sales year to date in Europe through May are down 37.1% to 75,196 units. Early signs suggest the slump will continue into June. In Sweden and Denmark, Tesla sales dropped over 60% in June for the sixth month in a row. The situation isn’t much better in the US. Tesla EV registrations for April dropped 16% to 39,913 registrations, according to data published by S&P Global Mobility (via Automotive News ). Meanwhile, General Motors' ( GM ) Chevrolet saw a 215% jump in EV registrations to finish in the second spot, with Ford ( F ) slipping to third place as sales fell 33%. Not surprisingly, Wells Fargo's Colin Langan wrote in a note to investors last week that Tesla's fundamentals are coming in worse than expected. The bank is expecting second quarter deliveries to be down 21% compared to a year ago, with the firm's 343,000 estimate significantly below Street consensus. Demand weakness in the US and EU comes after CEO Elon Musk's foray into Trump administration politics, which has caused some Tesla owners to become disillusioned with Musk, specifically by his right-leaning tendencies, support of right-wing leaders in Europe, and leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in the US. Musk's recent return to his businesses from politics is seen as a welcome move, but there is concern that Musk's escapades will permanently damage Tesla's reputation. Key to changing the overall Tesla story has been the company’s ongoing robotaxi tests in Austin, Texas. While the test seemed to begin smoothly earlier this week, recent videos of robotaxi rides depict Tesla vehicles going faster than posted speed limits and committing traffic violations like driving through turn-only lanes and crossing double-yellow lines. Though government regulators say they are watching, further testing and more vehicles added to the test are good news for Tesla, a company that finds its CEO touting the potential trillions in value created by AI and self-driving over the sliding fortunes of its core auto business .

The biggest winners from the crypto industry's triumphant 2025,2025-07-01 03:12:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-biggest-winners-from-the-crypto-industrys-triumphant-2025-151130351.html,"The crypto industry has emerged triumphant in the first half of 2025. Investors kicked off the year optimistic about the Trump administration's crypto-friendly stance, including talk of a strategic bitcoin reserve. But enthusiasm wavered early on, after the launch of Trump- and Melania-themed meme coins stirred controversy during a pivotal time for the crypto world. Momentum returned with the appointment of Paul Atkins as SEC chair and the introduction of a dedicated crypto czar, helping push bitcoin to record highs just below $112,000. A sharp sell-off followed Trump's April 2 ""Liberation Day"" tariffs, briefly cooling sentiment. But as June closes with stocks at record levels, crypto has reasserted itself as a top-performing asset. Year to date, bitcoin ( BTC=F ) is up 14%, outperforming the S&P 500's ( ^GSPC ) 5% gain. The token's total market capitalization compared to that of all cryptocurrencies has risen to 64% , while alternative coins have faltered . Meanwhile, crypto trading platform Coinbase ( COIN ) has soared more than 40% year to date. During the same period, trading platform Robinhood ( HOOD ) has rallied more than 130%. The stock hit an all-time high on Monday after the trading platform announced tokenized stock trading in the European Union — marking another step in its aggressive expansion into the crypto space. ""HOOD leaned early into crypto in 2021 and persisted through the regulatory headwinds in 2022/2023, while other brokers played conservative and are only now waking up to the crypto opportunity,"" Bernstein analysts wrote in May, noting Robinhood now forms 30% of US retail crypto trading revenues. Read more: How would Trump's strategic bitcoin reserve work? Earlier last week, Coinbase closed at a record high for the first time since November 2021, marking a stunning comeback, up more than 900% from its 2022 lows in the aftermath of the collapse of FTX . The company has emerged as the "" Amazon of crypto financial services ,"" Bernstein's Gautam Chhugani wrote last week. ""As the only crypto-native company in the S&P 500, Coinbase dominates US trading, operates the largest stablecoin business among exchanges, and serves as custodian for the majority of US spot bitcoin ETFs,"" he added. Coinbase is also a minority stakeholder in Circle ( CRCL ), an issuer of stablecoins USDC, digital tokens backed by the US dollar that are expected to transform the payments industry. Read more: Can you buy crypto with a credit card? See the pros and cons. Circle shares have surged as much as 500% above their recent blockbuster IPO price on June 5, fueled by the Senate's passage of the GENIUS Act, a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The measure, expected to make its way through the House and be signed into law this year, requires monthly disclosures and annual audits of issuers. It also opens the door for Big Tech companies like Meta ( META ) and ( AMZN ) to issue their own stablecoins. ""What we're dealing with now is essentially a relatively new industry whose presence in the financial market is currently being shaped,"" Yesha Yadav, professor of law at Vanderbilt University, told Yahoo Finance on Friday. Seaport Global's Jeff Cantwell recently rated Circle as a Buy with a $235 price target, calling the company a ""top-tier crypto disruptor."" ""We think the overall stablecoin market cap will reach $500 billion by the end of next year; longer term, we believe it could hit $2 trillion,"" Cantwell wrote.

""This influx of competition could reduce long-term market share expectations and pressure CRCL shares in 2025,"" Compass Point's Ed Engel wrote. Another potential headwind: interest rates. If the Federal Reserve begins cutting rates, yields on Treasurys would fall, impacting Circle's revenue. ""With interest rates projected to decline, Circle's long-term revenue potential hinges on expanding USDC supply, and growing market share amid intensifying competition from new regulated issuers,"" said Tanay Ved, a research analyst at crypto-data firm Coin Metrics.

Bessent talks Fed succession options as Trump sends note to Powell,2025-07-01 03:17:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bessent-talks-fed-succession-options-as-trump-sends-note-to-powell-171850277.html,"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday outlined the options to replace Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell as his boss Donald Trump published a letter he sent to Powell again asking for interest rates to be lowered. Bessent told Bloomberg Monday that there are ""people"" already at the Federal Reserve who are under consideration to become the next central bank boss after Powell’s term expires next May. It was among several new details the Treasury secretary provided about the administration’s thinking as the president and his advisers weigh options for how to fill Powell’s seat . Meanwhile, President Trump applied more pressure on Powell with a new Truth Social post that showed a note the president sent to Powell alongside a list of the central banks around the world with lower interest rates than the US. His press secretary held up the note to reporters at a White House press conference. ""Jerome—You are, as usual, 'Too Late',"" the note from Trump reads, telling Powell that he has ""cost the USA a fortune"" and urging him to ""lower The Rate—by a lot!"" Trump on Truth Social also widened his criticism to the entire Fed board: ""The Board just sits there and watches, so they are equally to blame.""

(Photo by ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images) · ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS via Getty Images One option being contemplated by the administration, Bessent said, is that Trump appoints a new person to the Fed’s board of governors to fill a new 14-year seat that opens up with the scheduled departure of Fed governor Adriana Kugler on Jan. 31 — and ""that person will go on to be chair when Powell leaves in May."" “Or we could appoint the new chair in May. Unfortunately, that's just a two-year seat,” he added in the interview with Bloomberg. Even though Powell’s chairmanship is up in May, his term as a member of the board of governors does not expire until 2028. Powell has not said whether he intends to remain as a member of the board of governors through the end of his term. When asked if there could be any confusion during the period before Powell leaves, Bessent dismissed that possibility by noting that ""obviously there are currently people at the Fed who are under consideration"" — without naming anyone in particular. “So why would there be any confusion if you add another candidate in January?” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) · ASSOCIATED PRESS Trump said this weekend in an interview that aired on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures” that he has three people in mind, without naming them. He did, however, use the name ""Kevin,"" which may have been a reference to former Fed governor Kevin Warsh. “Kevin is very talented; I don’t know if it’s going to be him,"" but added, “he wouldn’t be doing what Powell is.” What Trump said he wants is a looser approach to monetary policy: ""We are going to get some one into the Fed who is going to lower rates."" People close to the administration have mentioned Warsh as among the candidates who have been discussed, along with current Fed governor Christoper Waller, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, former World Bank president David Malpass, and Bessent. When asked by Bloomberg Monday if the Fed chair post was a job that Bessent wanted, he said: “I will do what the president wants but I think I have the best job in DC.” As for timing, he said ""we will be working on chair Powell's successor over the coming weeks and months."" Chairman of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell on June 25. (Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images) · SAUL LOEB via Getty Images He did not hide his views about the current Fed and whether it should be acting to lower rates, as Trump has repeatedly urged. He again argued that any inflation from Trump’s tariffs will be transitory. Because the Fed made a mistake in 2022 by not acting fast enough to combat a surge of inflation during the Covid-19 pandemic, “they seem a little frozen at the wheel here.” Waller and another Fed governor, Michele Bowman, have both made a case since the last Fed meeting for rate cuts in July, arguing that any inflation from tariffs will not linger. Powell and some of his other Fed colleagues continue to argue that the Fed should wait on any rate cuts to gauge the ultimate impact on inflation. Atlanta Federal Reserve president Raphael Bostic Monday said that he wants to wait and see how tariffs play out in the economy before making a decision on what to do with rates, cautioning that Americans could see higher inflation from tariffs that could be longer lasting. “I like to move in a direction when I know which direction to move in,” said Bostic in a conversation in the UK. “That would for me require more information than we have today.” Some people close to the administration has said that Trump may look to appoint Powell's successor early as a shot across the bow at the current chairman. When asked about the notion of Trump naming a ""shadow chair"" before Powell's term is actually up, Bostic said “if you're going to be a central banker, you're going to be used to people complaining about. But you turn on any TV in any country at any time, if it's a business channel, someone is saying the central bank should be doing something other than what they're doing."" ""If that's going to get you upset and worked up, you probably should do something else because...it just comes with the territory.” Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"
Oracle stock hits record high after disclosing multiple cloud services deals,2025-07-01 05:34:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-stock-hits-record-high-after-disclosing-multiple-cloud-services-deals-165828296.html,"Oracle stock ( ORCL ) jumped roughly 4% Monday to hit a record closing high after the software giant disclosed that it inked new multibillion-dollar cloud services agreements. In a filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the company provided commentary that CEO Safra Catz planned to share with other Oracle colleagues on Monday. ""Oracle is off to a strong start in FY26,"" Catz's statement read. ""Our MultiCloud database revenue continues to grow at over 100%, and we signed multiple large cloud services agreements including one that is expected to contribute more than $30 billion in annual revenue starting in FY28."" Read more about Oracle's stock moves and today's market action. In its 2025 fiscal year, which ended May 31, Oracle's revenue from its cloud services business amounted to $24.5 billion, and total revenue was $57.4 billion. Oracle shares jumped as much as 8.6% to an intraday high of $228. Last week, Oracle stock cleared a record high of just over $215. Shares have climbed more than 33% over the past month, ahead of the tech-heavy Nasdaq's ( ^IXIC ) 6.4% gain. Oracle's jump on Monday also follows a note from Stifel analyst Brad Reback upgrading the stock to Buy from Hold. Reback raised his price target on Oracle shares to $250 from $180, citing momentum in its cloud business. Reback wrote, ""Cloud gains should generate accelerating total revenue increases in coming years."" The company partnered with OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) and SoftBank ( SFTBY ) to launch the highly publicized $500 billion Stargate project to build out US AI data centers earlier this year, but the project has stalled . Reback wrote that ""while Oracle's expanding relationship with OpenAI is expected to contribute to Cloud growth going forward, management has indicated that potential revenue from the Stargate project would be incremental to current total Oracle revenue growth expectations."" Oracle's German headquarters. (Sven Hoppe/picture alliance via Getty Images) · picture alliance via Getty Images Like other Big Tech hyperscalers , Oracle has ramped up its spending to build out data centers to power artificial intelligence. Oracle's capital expenditures soared from $6.9 billion in its 2024 fiscal year to $21.2 billion in 2025 and are expected to rise to over $25 billion in the current year. Still, the company is spending much less than other tech firms. ""While the higher capital spending will lead to additional near-term gross-margin compression, there is no question this management team is extremely adept at managing expenses,"" Reback wrote. But just as Oracle touched new highs, lauded short seller Jim Chanos warned that the wider ecosystem of AI stocks could be nearing a pullback, likening the surge in AI stocks to the dot-com bubble. ""There is an ecosystem around the AI boom that is considerable as there was for TMT [technology, media, and telecommunications] back in '99 and 2000,"" Chanos told Bloomberg in an interview published Monday. ""But it is a riskier revenue stream because if people pull back, they can pull back capex very easily. Projects can get put on hold for six months or nine months, and that immediately shows up in disappointing revenues and earnings forecast if it happens."" ""We're not there yet, but that's one of the risks out there that I think a lot of people are underestimating,"" he said. StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.

"How a GOP accounting maneuver hides $3.8 trillion in red ink from Trump's 'big, beautiful bill'",2025-07-01 01:12:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-a-gop-accounting-maneuver-hides-38-trillion-in-red-ink-from-trumps-big-beautiful-bill-160900268.html,"As Senate Republicans barrel toward advancement in the coming days for President Trump's ""big, beautiful bill,"" they are now fully behind a controversial budget maneuver to hide $3.8 trillion in red ink. The GOP, in a 53-47 vote on Monday morning, turned back a Democratic effort to scrap an accounting approach known as a ""current policy baseline"" that takes the stance that extending current tax rates should be counted as having zero cost even if they are set to expire. The vote came even after Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer opened the day by charging that the change would lead the Senate down a ""fact-free road"" that could be felt for years to come and could even ""erode, even destroy the Senate."" Republicans defend the practice as a more realistic approach, but what the accounting maneuver doesn't change is the underlying fact that the bill being debated this week is projected to add trillions to the national debt if it becomes law. This bit of Washington arcana was front and center after the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found over the weekend that the Senate-revised bill would add at least $3.3 trillion to the national debt if passed — $900 billion more than the previous House version. Yet a recent Joint Committee on Taxation analysis of the tax component in the bill using this ""current policy"" approach and found a total cost of only about $442 billion in the coming decade. After economists untangled the math and put things into the more comprehensive ""current law"" framework, the true impact on the national debt was shown to be nearly 10 times higher, at about $4.2 trillion. The focus comes as GOP senators struggle to overcome internal disagreements on the price tag and other provisions. Senate Majority Leader John Thune and President Trump are continuing to push for votes on the package as soon as possible. A final vote in the Senate is likely on Monday or Tuesday. As for the price tag debate, Republican leaders have tried with mixed success to end debate on that question by citing the ""current policy"" total and saying it is more realistic. ""Extending the Trump tax cuts prevents a $4 trillion tax increase — this is not a change in current tax policy or tax revenue,"" Senate Finance Committee Chair Mike Crapo said in a recent statement. ""This score more accurately reflects reality by measuring the effects of tax policy changes relative to the status quo."" Yet the approach is being derided as a gimmick and upends decades of accounting practices. Henrietta Treyz of Veda Partners suggested Monday morning on a Yahoo Finance appearance that the impacts could be felt for years to come with the change that she says ""effectively paves the road, a beautiful road, for steamrolling through any further deficit increases that any party wants from now on."" She also called it an effective ""end of any sort of leash on deficit increases or spending from Congress."" 'An egregious budget gimmick' The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget recently added that the approach is ""an egregious budget gimmick"" that could have the larger effect of allowing trillions in new government borrowing in the years ahead. Andrew Lautz of the Bipartisan Policy Center has detailed how the method changed the Joint Committee tally score on a range of key tax issues in the bill. In one case, the ""current policy"" approach says Senate provisions to extend tax rates for individuals will cost about $83 billion over the coming decade. The full cost to the national debt, meanwhile, is projected to be over $2.2 trillion. Likewise, the price tag for plans to extend a higher standard deduction moves from $165 billion to $1.3 trillion under the different frameworks. The US Capitol Building is seen in May. (Kevin Carter/Getty Images) · Kevin Carter via Getty Images In an interview, Lautz added that many of the new additions to the tax code that are counted fully under ""current policy"" — notably Trump's campaign promises — are temporary and that eventually extending them could drive up the underlying costs further. ""We see that happening with no tax on tips, overtime, a whole bunch of temporary provisions in both the House and the Senate,"" he noted, saying it is reasonable to interpret that as ""an effort to drive down the on-paper cost of the bill"" but with Congress likely to extend them down the road if they prove popular. Such a future extension could cost zero under the ""current policy approach, a possibility that has worried economists since Senate Republicans began to signal this as their approach earlier this year . ""If this becomes the norm, then you could see both parties abuse it,"" Erica York of the Tax Foundation said, noting how Joe Biden could have leaned on this idea for a range of his priorities. From her perspective — as someone worried about debt — she added, ""It's not a good development."" This story has been updated with additional developments.

"What the $1 trillion rural wallet means for Walmart, Amazon",2025-07-01 00:15:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/what-the-1-trillion-rural-wallet-means-for-walmart-amazon-151513412.html,"The $1 trillion battle for America’s back roads is heating up, with Amazon ( AMZN ) and Walmart ( WMT ) at the forefront. The two retail giants are aggressively expanding their e-commerce and delivery capabilities across rural communities, hoping to unlock a largely underserved slice of consumer spending. ""Rural consumers spend more than you think,"" Morgan Stanley analysts said in a new report. The firm notes that the US rural market represents a $1 trillion opportunity in personal goods consumption, with rural households spending roughly 95% of what urban consumers do. Nearly 45 million Americans live in rural counties. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2023 Consumer Expenditure Survey, excluding autos and gas, rural consumers account for around one-fifth of US personal goods consumption. ""Rural consumers have been on the sidelines, waiting days or even weeks for basic goods that urban shoppers get in hours,"" said Jerry Sheldon, vice president of research and advisory firm IHL Group. ""That's about to change."" Walmart's stock is up 44% in the past year and 8% year to date as it gained further traction with inflation-weary shoppers across the income spectrum. Amazon stock has jumped 13% over the past year, but only 1% in 2025. ""What makes the rural push so crucial right now is that both Amazon and Walmart are ramping up investment at the same time, more aggressively than ever before,"" Morgan Stanley's Simeon Gutman said in an email. ""They've each been citing rural expansion repeatedly on recent earnings calls. That's the signal that really matters."" Both companies are trading far above the S&P 500's ( ^GSPC ) average price-to-earnings ratio, which requires them to continue to perform financially to keep investors' interest. Walmart has a head start in the rural market with its vast store network, affordable inventory, and grocery dominance, Morgan Stanley said. Its same-day delivery now covers 93% of the US population, up from 76% two years ago, and is expected to reach 95% by the end of 2025. Amazon, meanwhile, is betting that its speed, logistics know-how, and ability to innovate will close that gap. It's investing $4 billion through 2026 to beef up its rural delivery footprint to reach 4,000 rural US locations. ""Companies are always chasing growth, and this is clearly a major opportunity. While delivery costs are higher at first, as average order increases, those economics start to improve,” Sheldon added. Read more: Is the stock market open on July Fourth? The companies' rise poses a serious challenge to other big box and value retailers, such as Target ( TGT ), Kroger ( KR ), Dollar Tree ( DLTR ), and Albertsons ( ACI ), according to Morgan Stanley. Retailers with deep rural footprints of their own, like Dollar General ( DG ) and Tractor Supply ( TSCO ), also face new pressure. Amazon's expansion into small-town ZIP codes could siphon off value-conscious rural shoppers, who now expect faster, more reliable delivery options. Parcel carriers like FedEx ( FDX ) and UPS ( UPS ) could find themselves in the crosshairs. Amazon's move to vertically integrate its delivery network, especially in rural zones where FedEx has historically been stronger, could erode the parcel incumbents' share of residential shipping. Morgan Stanley estimates Amazon and Walmart collectively hold about 20% of the current rural retail market, with Walmart owning the lion's share today thanks to its 3,560 Supercenters, many of which could double as local fulfillment hubs. Roughly 60% of Walmart's US delivery orders are now fulfilled from those hubs, a major efficiency advantage over competitors. KeyBanc analyst Bradley Thomas told Yahoo Finance that Walmart's progress in logistics is a major tailwind for growth and margin expansion. ""It's taken 10 years for Walmart to reach this scale,"" he said. The company is attracting higher-income shoppers as delivery becomes part of its value proposition, much like Amazon Prime. Amazon, on the other hand, still boasts an edge in its breadth of selection and cost-effective delivery of everyday items. In the first quarter, its retail business sales rose 9% year over year to $155.7 billion while operating margin climbed from 10.7% the previous year to 11.8%. Walmart has also delivered a string of earnings beats. For its latest quarter, revenue climbed 2.5% year over year to $165.6 billion. Global e-commerce sales jumped 22% , and operating margins saw a modest improvement. Investors are also watching closely for potential disruption in the grocery and discount segments, where shifts in market share can happen quickly. While the broader market remains stable, interest rates, tariffs, and geopolitical uncertainty remain key wildcards for retail. Francisco Velasquez is an Associate Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

"Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev: EU will probably get 24/7 trading before US, and it would be a 'shame'",2025-07-01 05:04:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-ceo-vlad-tenev-eu-will-probably-get-247-trading-before-us-and-it-would-be-a-shame-150026609.html,"Robinhood ( HOOD ) has set the stage for 24/7 stock trading, at least in the European Union. The trading platform said Monday it has launched US stock and ETF tokens in the European Union at an event in Cannes, France. European Robinhood customers will have access to more than 200 US stock and ETF tokens. Stock token holders will also receive dividend payments directly in their Robinhood app. With tokenized stocks, the company's European app transitions from a crypto-only app to a broader offering where customers can invest in stocks and ETFs. Stock tokens will initially be issued on the blockchain player Arbitrum. Robinhood said tokenized stocks will soon be facilitated by its layer two blockchain. It said the technology, currently in development, will support 24/7 trading. ""We believe we can get that done [24/7 trading in the EU] within the next few months,"" Robinhood co-founder and CEO Vlad Tenev told me on Yahoo Finance's Market Domination . ""For our EU customers, at least that's the goal. And you already have it with crypto assets. So these stock tokens powered by crypto technology will use the same underlying infrastructure. So once they're available on Bitstamp, we believe will unlock 24/7 trading. So you'll get the Saturdays and the holidays. And I think that would be very compelling"" Using blockchain technology, tokenization is the process of creating a digital representation of a real asset. It essentially allows investors the ability to diversify their holdings by, for example, fractional ownership of an asset like a stock, art, or real estate. Financial services giants such as BlackRock ( BLK ) and Franklin Templeton have adopted tokenization for money market funds. BlackRock co-founder and CEO Larry Fink has been a vocal supporter of tokenization, as it democratizes investing access, shareholder voting, and yield. ""The world's money moves through plumbing built when trading floors still shouted orders and fax machines felt revolutionary,"" Fink said in his annual shareholder letter earlier this year. Consultancy McKinsey estimates that tokenized market capitalization could reach about $2 trillion by 2030, excluding cryptocurrencies in bitcoin and stablecoins. Tenev says it will likely take longer to get 24/7 stock trading approved by US regulators. ""I've talked about the need for 24/7 markets in the U.S for quite some time. It would be a shame for the EU to get there first. But I think the U.S. wants to catch up. We've been having a lot of conversations with the regulators,"" Tenev explained. ""We think actually the SEC has the ability to make this happen. So we're going to continue to collaborate with them to bring it to the U.S."" Other key product reveals at the Monday event for Robinhood include crypto perpetual futures in the EU. Shares rose more than 12% in today's session. The company has been aggressive in reinventing itself from a pure-play stock trading platform founded by Tenev and Baiju Bhatt in 2013. Watch: Why Robinhood's co-founder is all in on space In March, the company released Robinhood Banking to provide access to traditional checking and savings accounts. Robinhood Strategies now serves as a wealth management service. Its premium Gold subscribers pay a 0.25% annual fee, capped at $250. It also debuted a prediction markets hub in its app this year. The contracts allow users to wager on everything from what the fed funds rate could be to NCAA tournament games. The platform provider also debuted futures and index options trading last year. Robinhood shares are up 151% this year compared to a 5% advance for the S&P 500 and a 41% gain for rival Coinbase ( COIN ). ""In our view, Robinhood has successfully migrated from a fast growing, periodically profitable online broker servicing mostly younger investors, to a best-in-class top and bottom-line asset under custody compounder with a growing total addressable market (TAM),"" Goldman Sachs analyst James Yaro said. ""In the near-to-medium-term, we see growth driven by continued wallet share gains among highly-profitable active traders, and a long-term opportunity to expand Robinhood's TAM into areas, such as wealth and internationally.""

"Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman: AI can provide complex medical support, diagnoses",2025-06-30 23:34:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman-ai-can-provide-complex-medical-support-diagnoses-143458485.html,"Microsoft says its AI can now outperform doctors in diagnosing complex medical cases. ""We already have 50 million health-related queries per day coming through Copilot and Bing,"" Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid . ""Our goal is to provide the most high quality, most accurate, and ultimately the cheapest health advice and support."" The six-year relationship between Microsoft ( MSFT ) and Sam Altman's OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) is widely seen as one of the most successful tie-ups in recent memory. Microsoft has invested close to $14 billion in the ChatGPT maker, gaining access to its models. OpenAI has leveraged Microsoft's computing power to feed its ever-more-powerful models. OpenAI has gone on to raise billions, with its last round in March valuing it at $300 billion. The company's valuation has since climbed to $325 billion, according to Yahoo Finance private company data . Since disclosing an initial $1 billion investment in OpenAI on July 22, 2019, Microsoft shares are up 263%. The S&P 500 has gained 107%. In new research, the tech giant said the Microsoft AI Diagnostics Orchestrator (MAI-Dx0) can correctly diagnose up to 85% of the New England Journal of Medicine's case proceedings. That rate is more than four times higher than a group of experienced physicians. The best-performing MAI-DxO was paired with OpenAI's o3 model. Users shouldn't say goodbye to their doctors just yet. ""Your physician will be there to make the right judgment call at the right time, to plan treatment after diagnosis and to oversee and hold the AI accountable,"" Suleyman said. Recently, the relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI has begun to sour. OpenAI wants Microsoft to ease up its hold on its AI offerings and allow for its conversion to a for-profit company. The pact between the two is slated to last until 2030 but could end earlier if OpenAI's board declares it has developed artificial general intelligence (AGI). Suleyman downplayed any tension in the partnership. ""The relationship's in pretty good shape,"" he said. ""It's one of the best technology partnerships there has been, and it will continue for at least another five years, hopefully many decades after that."" He acknowledged ongoing discussions around the agreement, describing it as a ""very complicated contract,"" adding that they are part of a healthy, evolving alliance and one ""that's definitely going to continue."" Suleyman is one of the most prominent names in artificial intelligence. He was a co-founder of DeepMind, which Google acquired in 2014. He then became a vice president at Google for several years before leaving in 2022 to found AI startup Inflection. Suleyman joined Microsoft in his current role in March 2024 after securing a licensing deal for Inflection's core technology. As part of the deal, Suleyman, Inflection co-founder Karén Simonyan, and a majority of its employees joined Microsoft. At Microsoft, Suleyman now oversees all of its consumer AI products, including the Copilot app, Bing, MSN, and the Edge browser.

The controversy surrounding the bill's energy approach is just one front in a frenzied final push. The price tag has received plenty of additional attention after a new weekend tally found that the bill has grown by nearly $1 trillion since the Senate took it up. Meanwhile, a grueling final Senate push to approve the package cleared a key procedural hurdle over the weekend. Consideration is continuing, and an ongoing marathon amendment process is expected to take up much of Monday before a final vote later in the day or on Tuesday. The energy provisions of the 900-plus page bill have come under particular scrutiny after last-minute changes phased out clean energy tax credits faster than expected and added new taxes on wind and solar projects. At the same time, new last-minute inducements were unveiled for fossil fuels, including one classifying coal as a critical mineral when it comes to a government manufacturing credit. ""We're doing coal,"" Trump said in an interview released over the weekend on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" where he also called solar energy projects ""ugly as hell."" President Trump during a news conference at the White House on Friday. (Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images) · ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS via Getty Images The mix left fossil fuel advocates celebrating and clean energy advocates slamming the bill at a new, higher volume. Tesla ( TSLA ) CEO Musk, who worked in the White House before his dramatic falling out with the president , was perhaps the loudest voice in the latter group. He issued a series of weekend posts calling the bill ""utterly insane and destructive [with] handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future."" The energy changes came as the deal's top-line costs remained a key point of contention. A nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office tally released over the weekend showed the revised bill would add at least $3.3 trillion to the national debt. That assessment , which does not include additional interest costs, comes after a similar analysis of the House package found a $2.4 trillion tab. In one of his weekend posts , Trump suggested Republicans look past the deficit implications, urging passage as soon as possible, saying he also wants to cut costs but adding to lawmakers: ""REMEMBER, you still have to get reelected."" He also made a case that White House projections of blockbuster economic growth — dismissed by many economists as fantastical — will make the math add up in the end.

The initial Senate blueprint had offered a slower rollback of clean energy credits for things like solar panels and electric vehicles, but last-minute changes to the bill put it more in line with the harder-line House version , which seeks to eliminate the credits sooner. Some provisions are even more immediate, with the Senate version proposing to eliminate EV credits by September 30 of this year .

(Matt McClain/The Washington Post via Getty Images) · The Washington Post via Getty Images On top of that, a new tax was unveiled when the bill was released that would not only eliminate government help for renewable energy projects. It would also add a new cost for wind and solar projects completed after 2027 if a certain amount of supplies came from China. The changes stunned many clean energy advocates — not just Musk. A statement from the American Clean Power Association said the effect would be to ""strand hundreds of billions of dollars in current investments."" That could mean higher utility bills for consumers down the road, some concluded, as currently under-construction AI data centers are set to increase electricity demand in the years ahead. Some are even projecting double-digit price increases in some utility bills by 2029 . An analysis from the left-leaning Center for American Progress found that the bill would exacerbate existing upward pressure on utility prices. Democratic Senator Brian Schatz added that ""we are literally going to have not enough electricity because Trump is killing solar."" Fossil fuels advocates, meanwhile, were largely ebullient at the last-minute changes, which saw existing fossil-fuel-focused provisions around issues like permitting, lease sales, and methane emissions fees joined by some new credits for these producers, including for coal. Senate Republicans say the bill will generate over $15 billion in new federal revenue through expanded oil, gas, and coal leasing. Sen. John Barasso of Wyoming said , ""America is an energy superpower, and once again, we are going to act like it."" President Trump at a rally in Charleston, W.Va., in 2018, touting his support for coal. (Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images) · MANDEL NGAN via Getty Images A growing price tag The bill is also set to be even more expensive after weeks of negotiations saw expensive compromises on issues like state and local tax (SALT) deductions, more generous business tax credits, and the adjustment of some cost savings around Medicaid. The fullest accounting came over the weekend, when the CBO estimated the Senate bill would increase the debt by nearly $3.3 trillion from 2025 to 2034. The analysis also found that 11.8 million additional Americans would become uninsured by 2034 because of the healthcare provisions. This is an increase over the findings for the House-passed version, which tallied that 10.9 million people would be without health coverage if that version passed. The bill is projected to be even more expensive after things like interest costs are included. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget projects the current total tally is in the neighborhood of $3.5 trillion to $4.2 trillion over the next decade. ""The debt impact could rise as high as $4.5 trillion if various rumored adjustments are made,"" the group added regarding potential additional changes still to come. The findings also come as Senate Republicans push forward on a budget gimmick that is set to hide $3.8 trillion in red ink using a ""current policy baseline"" that Democrats say violated Senate rules but appears set to proceed. Either way, the sky-high debt findings could imperil the bill politically, with two GOP senators already likely to vote no and others not yet saying if they will back Trump's effort to get this over the line in the coming hours. The bill will also need to be approved by the House if the amended package advances and is then considered by a bloc of fiscal conservatives there who say they barely voted in May for that less-expensive version. One initial comment from the House Freedom Caucus was negative, with the group writing that the new tally was above ""our agreed budget framework.""

Disney stock upgraded by Jefferies 'for four primary reasons',2025-06-30 20:00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-stock-upgraded-by-jefferies-for-four-primary-reasons-100541372.html,"Disney ( DIS ) is cruising for a higher stock price this summer, according to Jefferies analyst James Heaney. Heaney lifted his rating on Disney to Buy from Hold on Monday. His new price target of $144 assumes 18% upside ahead from the entertainment giant's current level of $124.84 per share. Yahoo Finance data shows Heaney is now one of the most bullish on the Street with respect to Disney. ""We upgrade Disney to Buy for four primary reasons: 1) Now see limited risk of a second half parks slowdown from Epic Universe/Macro [economy]; 2) More positive on FY26 cruise [business] upside, Jefferies estimates $1 billion plus revenue uplift; 3) Continued direct-to-consumer margin expansion (0% FY24 to 13% plus by FY28 estimate); 4) View next six months content and sports slate favorably, including ESPN direct-to-consumer launch, Zootopia 2 and Avatar 3,"" Heaney wrote. Disney stock rose 2% in premarket trading on Monday. The stock is up 10% year to date, compared with a 4% advance for the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ). ""Disney has failed to grow operating income in FY16-FY24, but we believe this dynamic is set to change,"" Heaney added. His more bullish stance on Disney comes despite several headwinds facing the media giant. First, the media industry itself continues to face upheaval. Warner Bros. Discovery ( WBD ) said this month it will split up amid a shift to streaming that has financially hammered its legacy TV assets. The company joins rival Comcast ( CMCSA ) in separating TV operations from streaming assets. Meanwhile, Paramount ( PARA ) is still trying to close its merger deal with Skydance. Disney has repeatedly said it has no desire to spin off its TV networks , such as ABC, despite the industry challenges that have weighed on sales and profits. ""I think it's harder [to split up] than most people realize. And the interesting thing is, for the past five to 10 years, we have been putting them together — linear TV content creates the streaming content. Now all of that has changed,"" former BET CEO and current Warner Bros. Discovery board member Debra Lee told Yahoo Finance earlier in June. Club World Cup training for FC Bayern Munich before the start of the group matches at the ESPN Sports Complex. (Sven Hoppe/picture alliance via Getty Images) · picture alliance via Getty Images Second, Disney is still smack in the middle of appointing a CEO to succeed Bob Iger. Four internal candidates are reportedly being considered for the coveted position, which Iger held from 2005 to 2020 before returning in November 2022. Those four are entertainment division co-chiefs Dana Walden and Alan Bergman, parks division head Josh D'Amaro, and ESPN chairman Jimmy Pitaro. Walden and D'Amaro are rumored to be top contenders. The search process must be executed flawlessly, following a high-profile bungling last time, when former CEO Bob Chapek was fired in favor of bringing back Iger. Chapek's brusque management style famously clashed with the many creatives who keep the magic inside of Disney's content and theme parks. A CEO decision is widely expected by year-end. ""I think the biggest skillset you have to have is a gift of a real strategic business sense because there's a bunch of assets at Disney that are globally deployed,"" Candle Media CEO and former top Disney executive Kevin Mayer said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (watch above). ""It's multifaceted, from theme parks to consumer products to movies to film to TV to Disney+ to Hulu to ESPN. You got to manage a lot, and then you have to also decide, what assets do we keep?

Wall Street banks are rallying on a 'tale of 2 quarters',2025-06-30 17:00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-banks-are-rallying-on-a-tale-of-2-quarters-080035031.html,"The stocks of the biggest Wall Street banks are rallying at the end of the second quarter, defying the gloom that settled over the industry as the quarter began. Dealmaking froze in the weeks following President Trump’s April 2 ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcement, but it has since recovered on the back of some red-hot IPOs and sizable mergers. “I do think investment banking specifically is a tale of two quarters, one that started slow, really pausing in a big way, and now it's picked up,” Morgan Stanley ( MS ) CEO Ted Pick said at a conference hosted by his firm in early June. The stock of the largest US bank, JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ), opened at a new record high price on Monday, breaking the stock's previous high set at the end of last week. The KBW Nasdaq US Bank Index ( ^BKX ), which tracks the banking industry, has soared more than 37% since bottoming this year on April 7 and is now close to its previous 2025 high set in February. The new momentum at the end of the second quarter comes after JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and 20 other big banks passed an annual Federal Reserve stress test on Friday. The results of that test demonstrated that all big banks have enough of a buffer to withstand a severe recession, boosting their case for dramatic rollbacks in capital rules and other regulatory constraints from the Trump administration. Many of these lenders are expected to share their capital plans, which includes shareholder dividends, as soon as Tuesday afternoon. Investors in bank stocks are also encouraged by a bounce back of M&A and IPOs in May and June after virtually all activity came to a halt in April. About 30% of companies said in a May PwC survey that they paused or revisited pending deals due to tariffs. Worldwide investment banking revenue since the start of 2025 through June 27 — $44.8 billion — is slightly higher compared to the first two quarters of last year, according to Dealogic data. The second quarter by itself is down 4% from the same period last year. Certainly, there are also some reasons for unease as banks continue to face a number of unknowns after the run-up in their stocks. Most big banks are near or have exceeded their 2025 highs initially set in the weeks after Trump’s inauguration. Baird analyst David George offered some caution last week when he downgraded JPMorgan from Neutral to Underperform. “We realize we are fighting the tape here, and understand that JPM is a best-in-class franchise, with dominant share in all of their businesses,"" he said in a note, adding that ""we simply think that expectations are super high here.” 'A noticeable increase in momentum' The banks' tale of two quarters is expected to show up in the earnings of the biggest banks on Wall Street when they start to report their second quarter results in two weeks. Collectively, investment banking revenue at Bank of America ( BAC ), JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs ( GS ), Morgan Stanley, and Citigroup ( C ) is expected to fall 6% from the year-ago period to $7.7 billion, according to analyst estimates. Read more: The 10 best national and super regional banks of 2025 One early sign of what investors may see in those results came last week when a smaller Wall Street investment bank, Jefferies ( JEF ), posted its own second quarter earnings. It noted that investment banking revenue fell 2.7% from March through May compared to the same period in 2024 as US policy and geopolitical events “meaningfully slowed activity levels for the first two months of the quarter,” according to CEO Richard Handler and President Brian Friedman. But then in May, they added, “Some clarity came to the economy and markets, which began to restore investor confidence, and we experienced a noticeable increase in momentum.” They predicted good things for the rest of the year, citing a strong backlog and abundance of talk with clients. “We are increasingly optimistic about the second half of 2025.” Brian Moynihan, Chairman and CEO of Bank of America; Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase; and Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) · Win McNamee via Getty Images Investors will listen for similar guidance from Jefferies' larger rivals when the biggest banks start reporting earnings on July 15-16. ""If you're the CEO or the board and you're sitting there trying to decide, knowing the forward outlook, having confidence in your business, having confidence in the market, is one of the biggest drivers of letting you make that informed decision,"" Vito Sperduto, head of RBC US Capital Markets, told Yahoo Finance earlier this month. The recovery of the M&A market has been driven by big deals after the freeze-up of April. There were 33 megadeals worth $5 billion or more announced in May, something that hasn’t happened since 2020, according to PwC. The deals that have been announced are larger when compared to any past year going back to 1995, according to Dealogic. That is helping to offset an overall drop-off in the total number of deals. There have been fewer US M&A announcements so far this year than any corresponding period since 2009. Many of the big deals are coming from the world of technology and more specifically, artificial intelligence . Year to date, 51% of the US M&A deals have come from tech as measured by dollars, while seven of the 15 largest over the same period were AI-focused. The companies Wall Street helped go public following the freeze-up in April are also scoring big with investors. “If you bought and held every IPO since May 1, you’d be meaningfully outperforming the broader market,” Jim Cooney, head of the Americas equity capital markets team at Bank of America, said last week during a call with reporters. Jeremy Allaire, CEO and co-founder of Circle Internet Group, celebrates as he rings the opening bell on the day of the company's IPO, in New York City. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid · Reuters / Reuters By far the two biggest IPOs this year have been AI-cloud computing startup Coreweave and stablecoin issuer Circle. CoreWeave’s ( CRWV ) stock is up 310% since its March 28 IPO, while Circle ( CRCL ) has gained 480% since going public on June 5. “As long as IPOs continue to outperform, investor appetite will remain high,” BofA's Cooney added.

Globalization has been great for U.S. corporate profit margins,2025-06-30 03:56:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/globalization-has-been-great-for-us-corporate-profit-margins-185607639.html,"A version of this post first appeared on TKer.co The prospect of higher tariffs and other unfriendly trade policies is bad news for everyone exposed. By definition, tariffs raise costs, which is bad for inflation, productivity, economic activity, and corporate earnings. And what’s bad for corporate earnings is bad for the stock market . Policies that facilitate global trade have enabled countries to focus on their strengths and trade with others that can produce certain goods and services more efficiently. It’s a basic economic concept called "" comparative advantage ,"" and it explains why international trade is a win-win. ""U.S. companies have clearly benefited from globalization,"" Societe Generale analysts wrote. ""The S&P 500 (ex-Financials) has benefited on the cost front too, with its cost of goods sold as a % of sales having dropped by 700bps since China joined the WTO."" This chart from Societe Generale is striking. The cost of goods, as a percentage of sales, has been falling for years, helping explain why profit margins have been expanding . Costs of goods sold have been falling as a percentage of S&P 500 sales. (Source: Societe Generale) Some of this chart can be explained by technology companies, which boast relatively high margins, accounting for a larger share of the S&P. But as the analysts observed, eight of 11 sectors experienced gross margin expansion since China joined the WTO. Most sectors have benefited from globalization. (Source: Societe Generale) This trend could be blunted or potentially reversed depending on how aggressive any new protectionist trade policies are. That’s assuming all other things are held constant . It’s worth mentioning that Corporate America continues to be very good at figuring out how to maintain profitability and profit growth despite emerging challenges. So it's possible that many companies will find creative ways to navigate Washington's tariff roller coaster. That said, it’s hard to see how new tariffs or any other policy that disincentivizes globalization wouldn’t eventually lead to higher cost inflation, lower economic activity, or some combination of both. To that end, Q2 earnings season will be informative as Corporate America updates us on how the uncertain trade policy outlook is affecting business conditions.

Although business activity and new orders have continued to grow in June, growth has weakened amid falling exports of both goods and services. Furthermore, while domestic demand has strengthened, notably in manufacturing, to encourage higher employment, this in part reflects a boost from stock building, in turn often linked to concerns over higher prices and supply issues resulting from tariffs.

(Source: Atlanta Fed ) Putting it all together 📋 🚨 The Trump administration’s pursuit of tariffs threatens to disrupt global trade, with significant implications for the U.S. economy, corporate earnings, and the stock market. Until we get more clarity , here’s where things stand: Earnings look bullish : The long-term outlook for the stock market remains favorable, bolstered by expectations for years of earnings growth . And earnings are the most important driver of stock prices . Demand is positive : Demand for goods and services remains positive , supported by healthy consumer and business balance sheets . Job creation, while cooling , also remains positive , and the Federal Reserve — having resolved the inflation crisis — shifted its focus toward supporting the labor market . But growth is cooling : While the economy remains healthy, growth has normalized from much hotter levels earlier in the cycle. The economy is less ""coiled"" these days as major tailwinds like excess job openings and core capex orders have faded. It has become harder to argue that growth is destiny. Actions speak louder than words : We are in an odd period, given that the hard economic data decoupled from the soft sentiment-oriented data . Consumer and business sentiment has been relatively poor, even as tangible consumer and business activity continues to grow and trend at record levels. From an investor’s perspective, what matters is that the hard economic data continues to hold up. Stocks are not the economy : Analysts expect the U.S. stock market could outperform the U.S. economy , thanks largely to positive operating leverage . Since the pandemic, companies have aggressively adjusted their cost structures. This came with strategic layoffs and investment in new equipment , including hardware powered by AI. These moves are resulting in positive operating leverage, which means a modest amount of sales growth — in the cooling economy — is translating to robust earnings growth . Mind the ever-present risks : Of course, we should not get complacent. There will always be risks to worry about , such as U.S. political uncertainty , geopolitical turmoil , energy price volatility , and cyber attacks . There are also the dreaded unknowns . Any of these risks can flare up and spark short-term volatility in the markets. Investing is never a smooth ride : There’s also the harsh reality that economic recessions and bear markets are developments that all long-term investors should expect as they build wealth in the markets. Always keep your stock market seat belts fastened .

American journalist Don Lemon is best recognized for his prior role as a host for CNN, holding an on-air position from 2014 until his departure in 2023. Since then, he’s been producing his own news segments independently through his business, the Lemon Media Network. On Yahoo Finance’s Living Not So Fabulously podcast, Lemon detailed how he managed to forge a successful career in media and offered four clear pillars for those looking to build wealth. “Invest in your home,” Lemon advised. “Invest in your business. Invest in yourself. Don't invest in things.” Though he’s a well-recognized name in the world of broadcast journalism, Lemon’s career was not always so financially lucrative. Lemon’s first journalism gig only paid him $5 an hour in New York City. “This was back in the early '90s. And I started as a trainee in the newsroom basically answering phones, opening mail, and going to get dry cleaning or lunch from the loading dock for the higher ups,” Lemon explained, revealing that he was making so little for the six months he worked there that his parents needed to help him pay for his sublet. “You don't make a lot of money when you're starting out. The first full-time on-camera job I got was — I did OK, but it was meager.” Don Lemon attends the world premiere of ""Heads of State"" at Alice Tully Hall on Tuesday, June 24, 2025, in New York. (Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP) · Evan Agostini/Invision/AP As he slowly worked his way up the ladder, Lemon said he was able to make enough money to support himself — but at first it was far from substantial wealth. “There's a difference between being rich and being wealthy, right?” he said. “Being able to afford to pay your bills and having a little bit extra, you know, some people would call that upper middle class or some folks would call that rich. Until you get to a certain level where the air is really rarefied, you don't really make that much money in media on television.” Read more: A 6-step guide to start investing Lemon noted that one way he accumulated wealth was by buying properties that suited his income and trading them up over time, though he acknowledged that fortunate timing allowed him to make these savvy real estate investments. He explained that when he made his first real estate purchase, the average cost of a home was three times the median salary; today, a home in America is usually six times the median salary — something that “concerns” him. Regardless of wealth-building strategy, Lemon emphasized that his early, leaner salaries taught him a key lesson he still carries with him: “learning to live within your means.” “I don't really care about luxury,” he said. “I don't care about brands. ... You know what I love more than that? I love opening up my phone and going, 'Oh, look at my bank account.'” Read more from Living Not So Fabulously: Don Lemon shares the 4 investing rules he learned building a career in media ‘Severance’ actor Jen Tullock describes the financial constraints many actors face How comedian Mo Welch came back from financial rock bottom As Lemon is now working independently from a network, he’s had to navigate the financial balance of building a business, and he admitted that there were some mistakes he made along the way. “I think I spent way too much money in the beginning on doing things that I didn't necessarily need,” he said. “But you live and you learn, and that's what happens in business.

How F1 aims to enter its 'biggest untapped market' with new arcade experience,2025-06-30 00:16:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-f1-aims-to-enter-its-biggest-untapped-market-with-new-arcade-experience-151659931.html,"Listen and subscribe to Sports Report on Apple Podcasts , Spotify , or wherever you find your favorite podcasts. Formula One racing has become increasingly popular in the US, and F1 is looking to appeal to more than just racing fans with the rollout of F1 Arcade locations across the country. F1 Arcade, which entertains guests with live racing simulators and a variety of food and drink, has already opened locations in three US cities this year, and it plans to open three more. Residents in Boston, Las Vegas, Denver, Austin, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C., will have the opportunity to dive into the newest experience. F1 Arcade global president of development Jon Gardner said on Yahoo Finance's Sports Report podcast that the US is currently ""the biggest untapped market"" for F1. In Las Vegas alone, those who attend F1 events spend an estimated four times as much as other Vegas visitors. Liberty Media ( FWONB ) has also inked a 10-year, $600 million deal, bringing the internationally popular races to the city. Gardner emphasized that partnerships like this and interactive experiences, like F1 Arcade, will only help expand F1's reach and build a bigger audience. ""You might not be interested in Formula One, but you might be interested in the driver or what they're interested in, and then that's your gateway into this,” Gardner said. ""[Formula One is] putting a lot of resource and capital behind the US. I think they see us as a matter of funnel for them, attracting the F1 fans with the non-F1 fans who, again, might want a night out, might want to do something fun that they have not done before. And then that creates more interest in the overall sport."" Gardner discussed how the partnership with the increasingly popular racing brand has a wider appeal. ""This is not just for F1 fans,"" Gardner said. ""Yes, we want F1 fans to come here, but this is for people that want a new experience and to try something they've not had before."" He explained that F1 Arcade is marketed toward a more general audience for ""date night, group events, [and] social events."" And the pursuit of non-fans has guided F1 Arcade's strategy when choosing new branch locations. Gardner said F1 Arcade isn't necessarily ""shying away"" from markets where F1 already has a following, but at the same time, ""It's also looking where the right location is in the right time."" He continued, ""We have big sites; they're not the easiest to find. ... So finding the right partners from a landlord, finding the right deal structure, and then finding the right area that we feel like we can get involved in, in a deep way, all those things come together to create where we end up."" A general view of F1 X at Grand Prix Plaza during a VIP preview of the world's largest Formula One attraction in Las Vegas. (Denise Truscello/Getty Images for Grand Prix Plaza) · Denise Truscello via Getty Images Gardner thinks the F1 Arcade can cater to American consumers' desire for unique experiences, drawing a wide audience for a few memorable visits rather than creating more consistent customers. Between 2019 and 2023, Americans increased their spending on experiences by 65%, according to Forbes . ""We [want] people to come back, and that repeat [customer] is very important to us, but ultimately they're not coming back to us 30 times a year, right?"" Gardner said. ""So they come back to us three, four times a year, that's amazing. But they're going to fill other weekends and other date nights out going other places."" Ultimately, Gardner feels the memorable experience the F1 Arcade offers will draw fans and non-fans alike. ""I also think people want new experiences,"" he said. ""I think attention spans are getting shorter, people want to be able to interact, and they're not going into the office maybe as they used to. So people are finding ways to connect with colleagues and their partners and find something to do while they're having a drink or having food.""

"Kerry's notebook: Larry Fink wants your 401(k), investors are squeamish, what's Social Security hiding?",2025-06-29 23:30:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kerrys-notebook-larry-fink-wants-your-401k-investors-are-squeamish-whats-social-security-hiding-143041392.html,"Every week or so, I bank some personal finance nuggets that don't make it into my Yahoo Finance columns. So now — and in weeks to come — I'll be clearing out my notebook. Here we go: Private equity comes to your 401(k)? BlackRock (BLK) announced this week that it’s launching a target-date fund that will consist of private credit, private equity, and other investments, aiming to increase the annual return an extra 0.5% — and roughly 15% more money in your 401(k) over a 40-year lifecycle of a target date solution. Invest in Gold Thor Metals Group: Best Overall Gold IRA Learn More American Hartford Gold: #1 Precious Metals Dealer in the Nation Learn More Priority Gold: Up to $15k in Free Silver + Zero Account Fees on Qualifying Purchase Learn More Powered by Money.com - Yahoo may earn commission from the links above. The fund will be offered by Great Gray Trust, which offers retirement investment options and manages over $210 billion in assets. Empower, the second-largest retirement services provider in the US, has aligned with top-tier private investment fund managers and custodians, including Apollo Global Management (APO) , Yahoo Finance’s owner, and Goldman Sachs (GS) . BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink proposed this idea a few months ago. Instead of a traditional 60/40 split between stocks and bonds, he wants everyday investors to branch out and diversify into private market assets. “The future standard portfolio may look more like 50/30/20 — stocks, bonds, and private assets like real estate, infrastructure, and private credit,” Fink wrote in his annual letter to clients in April. Sounds good on the surface, but there's a big red flag in all this: more risk. That’s a big concern for me and many experts I spoke with this week. There are trade-offs. These investments are riskier than the run-of-the-mill index funds most target-date retirement funds hold, have higher fees, and are less liquid. That makes it a scramble to pull funds out if the markets drop, so a long investment horizon is critical. The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s Office of the Investor Advocate announced this wee k that it will look into the use of private equity and other alternative investments in retirement accounts.

Social Security has gone dark on reporting its processing times for benefits and help on its website. The SSA took down six webpages that contained a collection of performance statistics about live phone and claims data around June 6, according to a memo written by researchers with the Strategic Organizing Center, a nonprofit labor alliance, provided to Yahoo Finance. For 10 days, the page was offline. If you went to the site, it read: “Under Maintenance. This section is currently being improved. Sorry for the inconvenience.” The page remained offline until the SSA put up an altered page on June 16th. Most previous statistics and charts were deleted, and all data was consolidated into a single page with three sections. That new page offers a, shall we say, streamlined view of the agency’s customer service performance. I will boil this down for you. The main message for seniors is — don’t come see us. “Very few services require you to visit a field office,” according to the website. “We encourage you to go online to reduce your wait time and avoid a trip to the office.” Well, that’s easier said than done for older Americans who don’t have access to internet services or lack computer skills. A note on the site says that the average time to wait for a field office appointment after contacting the agency is 34 days. Phone help can require a three-hour wait time or more. But hold on. Wait time to access online services — 0 minutes is shown at the top of the page. Also: The page does not provide the Social Security 800 number. Not a bad way to discourage callers. In April, as I wrote, the agency faced backlash about limiting customer service for millions of seniors and backed off its plan to cut phone service. Kathleen Romig, director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, told me this is the latest move Commissioner Frank Bisignano has made to pull back data previously available to the public. She added that SSA also pulled videos of operational meetings, data on staff losses this year, and even most of the organization chart (which now only names Bisignano). Read more: When will I get my Social Security check? Payment schedule for 2025. Many Americans need more personal help figuring out Social Security questions, not less. The reality is that most Americans are clueless about basic concepts of how Social Security and other retirement topics work, according to a recent report from the TIAA Institute and the Global Financial Literacy Excellence Center at the George Washington University School of Business. Curious about your retirement know-how? Take the abbreviated quiz below. This is not a Jeopardy question. Nearly half of workers who estimate how much they need to have saved for retirement are just guessing, according to a new report by the nonprofit Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies. A large portion of workers in each generation imagine they will need to save a cool million or more. Possibly, they’re on target. But hello. Stop dart tossing and at least check out calculators on sites such as AARP , Bogleheads , Fidelity , or Vanguard to get a better handle on this calculation. Also troubling, according to the Transamerica report, more than 6 in 10 workers admit they do not know as much as they should about investing for retirement. Lack of retirement literacy is a reality for most Americans, as I mentioned above. Experts, me included, surmise that it’s not so much that people are stupid as that they just haven’t or don’t want to think about how they would like their retirement years to play out — what types of things they will want and need to spend their money on so they can enjoy life.

‘Fog in the data’: Soaring stock market nears second half of 2025 with lingering uncertainty,2025-06-30 18:11:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fog-in-the-data-soaring-stock-market-nears-second-half-of-2025-with-lingering-uncertainty-133029948.html,"Stocks made a swift and historic comeback from the market's April bottom, with the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) closing at a record high on Friday. Now, as the first half of 2025 draws to a close, overarching risks are all but removed. From tariff-driven inflation pressures to conflicting economic signals and murky data, what lies ahead is anything but straightforward. Read more: How to protect your money during turmoil, stock market volatility ""We are going to see an inflation reacceleration that will be tariff-induced,"" EY chief economist Greg Daco told Yahoo Finance on Friday. ""There's more pressure to come into the economy [and that will lead to] income erosion and a consumer spending slowdown. That is really the picture that we should expect in the second half of this year."" The latest reading of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge reflected some of those concerns, with price increases accelerating in May as inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target amid underlying signs of slowing economic growth. ""The broad picture is that we are going to be in an environment where we're going to see increased fog in the data at the same time as there is increased fog from policy uncertainty,"" Daco said, adding it's a ""combo that is not ideal for anybody that is looking to plan for the next few years."" That includes the Federal Reserve, as policymakers walk a delicate line when deliberating potential rate cuts. And while some Fed officials have reopened the door to a July cut , Daco believes the bar remains high. ""I think we should not expect a July rate cut,"" he said. ""The majority of the FOMC voting members are not on board."" Instead, Daco sees September as the more likely pivot point, with economic momentum expected to cool further in the coming months. ""We will have seen more demand erosion, we will have seen a labor market that unfortunately has slowed, and income growth as a result has slowed,"" the economist explained, noting that this slowdown could outweigh the risk of near-term inflation reaccelerating from tariffs. “The Fed is going to have to decide to, on the side of caution, focus more on the growth slowdown because the inflation effect is likely to be short-lived.” Those economic concerns, however, have yet to weigh heavily on investors. Markets have powered higher, led by strength in tech and financials, as consumer sentiment rebounds and traders digest growing clarity around trade policy. “The markets are starting to focus on some of the more positive growth aspects,” said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist, pointing to the eventual passage of President Trump’s tax bill , deregulation efforts, and the anticipated arrival of rate cuts. ""So I think all that means the market does move higher,"" he added. ""But there will certainly be some gut checks along the way."" Investors are navigating a landscape marked by record highs. (JOHANNES EISELE/AFP via Getty Images) · JOHANNES EISELE via Getty Images Investors were hit with one of those gut checks late Friday, when President Trump said he wa s cutting off trade talks with Canada, just hours after confirming the US had reached an understanding with China. It served as a sharp reminder that with Trump, even the expected remains unpredictable. Another switchback came as Canada rescinded the tech tax that drew Trump's anger, getting the talks back on track and lifting market spirits. In a sign of that uncertainty, several high-profile companies, including General Motors ( GM ), American Airlines ( AAL ), Mattel ( MAT ), and many others, withdrew guidance this past earnings season, citing concerns around global trade. While that added to market uncertainty, it also lowered expectations, setting the stage for potential upside surprises in the second half of the year. ""When that happens, we have a lower bar that we can absolutely exceed, which is why we usually do very well every earnings season,"" said Jessica Inskip, director of investor research at StockBrokers.com. ""But we can also focus on the knowns, like more IPO activity and the AI narrative coming back to life."" Allie Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

"Reddit stock: Buy, sell, or hold?",2025-06-29 21:30:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reddit-stock-buy-sell-or-hold-123008980.html,"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings I have spent the entire week live on Opening Bid discussing tech. Nvidia's ( NVDA ) record-high stock price . Circle's ( CRCL ) exploding — then plunging — stock price . Micron's ( MU ) surprisingly strong quarter, coming a day after FedEx's ( FDX ) limp quarter suggested economic weakness ahead. The potential of a new tech bubble as traders pile into the July 30 rate cut from the Federal Reserve narrative. But all week long, I didn't mention a single social media name. No Meta ( META ). No Snap ( SNAP ). No Reddit ( RDDT ). I should've mentioned Reddit, however. While the stock is playing its part in the major jump in tech stocks the past month (+37%), shares are still down 14% year to date amid fears that Google's AI initiatives will drive traffic away from Reddit content. After talking with experts this past week and earlier at the Cannes Lions conference , I think the relative underperformance of Reddit's stock versus the market is overdone. ""Reddit is at the epicenter of disruptive finance and a major player in the years ahead,"" Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives told me. The company has greatly improved the content quality on its platform, attracting advertisers' interest. It's also making a large investment in AI-powered search to serve up more relevant content. Reddit COO Jen Wong told me at Cannes Lions (video above) that the company is all in on AI. ""Reddit is a lot of conversation in words, so AI allows us to machine translate global conversations into multiple languages, and we're doing this today in French and German, in fact, and in almost 12 different languages,"" Wong said. ""And these are conversations that are about universal life experiences, like parenting or pop culture."" The company is defending its business against AI chatbot startup and web scraper Anthropic (and others of its ilk). That could have a positive outcome for the business. ""What's important to us is that we are able to protect our users' privacy, their deletion rights, like we have policies that ensure that when users take down a post, the post is taken down,"" Wong said. ""And so it's really important, and as we've said in our terms of service, that we have a conversation with folks who have access to our data because that's a commitment that we have in terms of our policies, and it's also to know how Reddit data is used."" Reddit filed a new lawsuit earlier this month claiming that Anthropic intentionally scraped its users' personal data without their consent. Anthropic then allegedly used that data to train its large language model Claude. On the other hand, content publishers such as Reddit continue to face challenges in the AI age. Big Tech has been forking over cash for licensing agreements to use publishers' archives to train large language models. The New York Times ( NYT ) recently inked a multiyear deal to license content to Amazon ( AMZN ) for AI-related uses, marking its first generative AI contract. In 2023, the company sued OpenAI and Microsoft ( MSFT ), alleging the tech companies illegally used millions of its articles to train chatbots. News Corp. ( NWS ), owner of the Wall Street Journal, signed a five-year licensing deal with OpenAI in May 2024 worth a reported $250 million. For its part, Reddit struck a deal with Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ) in 2024 that allows the search giant to use posts from its site to train its AI models. The arrangement was reported to be worth $60 million. It also signed a similar deal with OpenAI in 2024. I fancy more of these are coming later this year due to the value of Reddit's human-generated content. Anthropic will probably end up paying up too. Wall Street is taking notice of the Reddit story. Two sell-side analyst notes caught my attention this week: ""Overall, we come away with the view that Reddit has a viable strategy to reduce the current top-of-funnel user volatility ... we have a greater appreciation of the durability of current revenue growth given the strong ARPU (average revenue per user) tailwinds and the fact that the vast amount of monetization currently comes from logged-in users which are showing far less volatility,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Benjamin Black wrote. ""Moreover, the company remains front-footed on product, rolling out Dynamic Shopping Ads this quarter, refining Reddit Answers, in addition to working on a growing suite of automation tools."" ""As an aside, Reddit came up in most of our conversations with marketers, brands, and agencies suggesting significant growth in awareness amongst this community. The net/net here, we come away from our meeting incrementally positive on shares of Reddit,"" Citi analyst Ron Josey wrote. I won't sit here and blow smoke that Reddit's stock is cheap from a valuation perspective. Shares trade on a forward P/E multiple of 113 times, according to Yahoo Finance data . However, if the market is going to strongly embrace high-multiple tech names again (as seen currently), then Reddit could be worth a look. The company is growing its top and bottom lines by double digits, isn't weighed down by money-losing hardware businesses like Meta, and is crushing Snap in terms of execution. Those are things you can get behind, provided you are bullish on tech. StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.

A crucial jobs report meets a stock market at all-time highs: What to know this week,2025-06-30 18:14:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/a-crucial-jobs-report-meets-a-stock-market-at-all-time-highs-what-to-know-this-week-113259792.html,"The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) is back at an all-time high for the first time since February as optimism around Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and fading fears of tariffs have driven stocks higher. In the final full trading week of June, the S&P 500 rose 3.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) rose more than 4.1%. Both indexes ended the week at all-time highs. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) added about 3.8%. The June jobs report will headline the first week of July. Fresh readings on job openings and wage data, as well as manufacturing and services activity, will also be in focus for investors. Investors will also have a close eye on any updates regarding President Trump's various tariff pauses ahead of the administration's self-imposed tariff delay deadline on July 9. Markets will close at 1 p.m. ET on Thursday and remain shut on Friday for the Fourth of July. A potential summer cut Markets are increasingly optimistic that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates soon. As of Monday, markets were pricing in a 21.2% chance the central bank cuts interest rates at its next meeting in late July, up from a 14.5% chance seen last week, per the CME FedWatch Tool . Meanwhile, the probability investors are placing on a cut by the end of September has surged, with markets now pricing in a 93% chance the central bank will have lowered rates by then, up from a 70% chance seen just a week ago. The shift comes as several Fed officials have alluded to the possibility of cutting interest rates as soon as the central bank's July meeting. Read more: How the Fed rate decision affects your bank accounts, loans, credit cards, and investments In a speech on June 23 , Federal Reserve governor Michelle Bowman noted that although the labor market is showing signs of strength, it ""appears to be less dynamic."" ""With inflation on a sustained trajectory toward 2%, softness in aggregate demand, and signs of fragility in the labor market, I think that we should put more weight on downside risks to our employment mandate going forward,"" Bowman said. However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has been more cautious about interest rate cuts. While testifying in front of House lawmakers last week, Powell stressed that the central bank is ""well-positioned to wait"" before moving interest rates. EY chief economist Greg Daco told Yahoo Finance he believes the Fed will likely cut in September. ""By then we will have seen more demand erosion, we will have seen a labor market that unfortunately has slowed and income growth as a result has slowed, leading to slower consumer spending activity,"" Daco said. Labor check-in Signs of cooling in the labor market have been a key part of the brewing debate over Fed policy and will put further emphasis on the incoming June jobs report, due out for release at 8:30 a.m. ET on Thursday. Economists expect the report to show 116,000 nonfarm payrolls were added, a move lower from the 139,000 seen in May. The unemployment rate is anticipated to have moved up to 4.3% from 4.2% the month prior. ""We expect the moderation in hiring to continue,"" Wells Fargo's team of economists, led by Jay Bryson, wrote in a note to clients on Friday. ""Demand for new workers remains muted amid still-elevated uncertainty, restrictive monetary policy and the ongoing federal government hiring freeze."" Back to record highs The S&P 500's most recent record close comes as the market has rallied more than 23% from its April 8 bottom. Now, strategists believe the market's largest tariff fears are behind investors. Economic forecasts have once again begun reverting higher , along with projections for corporate earnings this year. And Wall Street strategists are becoming incrementally bullish on the outlook from here. As our chart below shows, the S&P 500 has chugged past a slew of headwinds to hit a record high this year. ""The market still does tend to have a bullish sentiment to it,"" Charles Schwab head of trading and derivatives strategist Joe Mazzola told Yahoo Finance.

How to become a 'sponsor' at work and help someone's career take off,2025-06-29 00:00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-to-become-a-sponsor-at-work-and-help-someones-career-take-off-150029426.html,"If you really want to boost your career — and help other people rise — be a sponsor. In today’s workplace that mashes up remote and hybrid and shrinking payrolls, it’s tricky to find a champion to help you stand out and have your back. In “The Doors You Can Open: A New Way to Network, Build Trust, and Use Your Influence to Create a More Inclusive Workplace, ” Rosalind Chow, a Carnegie Mellon University organizational behavior professor and researcher, explains the value of having someone in your organization who is willing to put their own reputation on the line to help you get noticed — and talks you up to those who don’t yet know how awesome you are. Chow’s theory is that the path to leadership runs through helping people we respect get noticed and break barriers. It’s pushing someone else’s career ahead by advocating for raises, promotions, and participation in projects that have a direct impact on an employer’s bottom line. Sign up for the Mind Your Money weekly newsletter Subscribe By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy I asked Chow to share some insights on how sponsorship works and why it's a two-way street. Here are edited excerpts of our conversation: Kerry Hannon: What is sponsorship vs. mentorship? I’ve been a mentor and a mentee, but not sure I’ve ever been a sponsor. Rosalind Chow: The key difference is with mentorship, mentors are essentially coaching mentees, giving feedback and encouragement. Sponsorship is not about asking a protégé to be any different than who they are, but to change how other people see that person. Isn’t sponsoring just a step further than mentoring someone? Sponsors can start as mentors, but they are not mentors on steroids. It's a different way of supporting people, and you need both. Talk em' up: Chow (Photo courtesy of Rosalind Chow) What are the risks and the rewards of being a sponsor? It's like making a stock investment. There is some risk, but high reward potential. Sponsors who bring an amazing protégé to other people's attention — someone who other people were totally unaware of — are going to get a reputational boost. The risk of that is if you sponsor someone, and it turns out that they're not everything that you've hyped them up to be. The difference between sponsorship and mentorship is when your mentee doesn't do well, mentors typically are not seen negatively because their mentee does poorly. Most people just assume that the mentee is the problem. But with sponsorship, if a protégé goes out and does a bad job, it's not only that they look bad, but the sponsor looks bad. You’re tying your reputation to somebody else. So when a protégé does well, it means you do well too. But if a protégé does poorly, then you also get taken down. What does a sponsor do? Sponsorship can take many different forms. In general, it’s impression management — you are managing other people's impressions of someone. You are shaping a narrative around someone else who may not be known to others in positions of power. Or even if they're already known to other people, you're augmenting that positive perception that other people have of this person. The low-hanging fruit for sponsorship is just paying attention to what people are good at, or what they are interested in, or where they want to go. Then putting in a good word with the right people at the right time. The truth is saying nice things about other people is always the right thing to do anyway. Do you tell someone that you want to be their sponsor? It depends. There are two different lines of thinking. One is being very explicit with the person that you're sponsoring. If you do that, they realize that they're on the hook. For some people that's incredibly motivating and it makes them perform better. But for other people, if they find out about it, they interpret it as having a lot of slack, or latitude, to make mistakes or not have to put as much effort in. And you don’t have to sponsor someone who reports to you. You can sponsor a colleague or peer. What's the difference between power and status? Power is typically control over resources. I have something that you need. Status is about respect and admiration. You can get respect and admiration in lots of different ways. What sponsors do is essentially raise the status of the people they know by connecting them and telling these positive stories about them to other people. You write that it’s better to show than to tell when you are sponsoring someone — how so? Showing is when you put the protégé in a situation where they basically get to shine and other people draw their own conclusions. I'm not just telling you that this person is good at something. I am going to let them present the project so that it becomes clear that they have this expertise. Telling is when I go into a performance review meeting, and I say: ""This person is our expert in this."" You're telling the other person what they're supposed to think, and it means, then, that the other person has to trust your judgment. Showing is better. Have a question about retirement? Personal finances? Anything career-related? Click here to drop Kerry Hannon a note. What's your big takeaway for your readers? Everyone can be a sponsor, and it is not predicated on being in a position of power — but, rather, your reputation and other people's trust in you. Helping somebody by spending time with them and giving them feedback is great. I am absolutely not saying that they shouldn't do that, but are there people who ought to know one another? Can you do more introducing? Can you say more about the good things that are happening in other people's lives? Sharing other people's good news will help your career and someone else's. You hone your reputation as someone who feels secure in yourself and is in the know and paying attention to what’s going on with other people without feeling threatened by their talent.

This week in Trumponomics: Dueling Fed chairs,2025-06-28 23:00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/this-week-in-trumponomics-dueling-fed-chairs-140013719.html,"When it comes to the Federal Reserve, President Trump can’t get no satisfaction. He wants the Fed to cut interest rates, and it continually declines to do so. He mused about firing Fed Chair Jerome Powell earlier this year, but the Supreme Court quashed that idea . He routinely trolls Powell anyway, to no effect. So now Trump says he may choose a replacement for Powell months before Powell’s term expires in May 2026. Powell would stay in his job until next May, while the “shadow chair” offered a kind of alternative view of what the central bank’s monetary policy could be, or would be once Powell was gone. That might telegraph to markets that lower rates and looser monetary policy are coming once Powell exits. Read more: How the Fed rate decision affects your bank accounts, loans, credit cards, and investments Like much of what Trump does, the idea is unprecedented and jarring. The Fed is the most powerful financial institution in the world, fully able to move markets and drive the direction of the economy. Investors parse every word the Fed chair utters, looking for signs of future action. Two voices saying contradictory things about Fed policy couldn’t possibly be helpful. But is the idea really that crazy? Corporations do CEO succession planning all the time, and it’s actually considered mismanagement if they don’t plan for the departure of key executives. Warren Buffett said in May that he finally plans to step down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of this year, with longtime deputy Greg Abel taking the job. Buffett and his now deceased partner, Charlie Munger, had been talking up Abel for several years , so shareholders expected and welcomed the news. There’s a difference, however, between prudent succession planning and what Trump seems to have in mind. Abel is not going to spend the rest of 2025 going on TV to call out all the mistakes he thinks Buffett might be making and promising to shake things up the moment Buffett is gone. He could make subtle changes over time, but investors broadly expect him to manage Berkshire much as Buffett has. Trump wants regime change at the Fed, not continuity. Whoever he picks will undoubtedly be more dovish than Powell and far more willing to cut rates. Powell and a majority of the Fed’s policymakers have been holding off on rate cuts since last December, waiting to see if inflation picks up. Many economists think that’s prudent, given that Trump’s tariffs are a tax pushing up costs, which could add a full percentage point or more to the inflation rate. The Fed normally raises rates to head off inflation, and cutting rates amid rising inflation can make a price surge worse. Read more: How jobs, inflation, and the Fed are all related Trump seems not to care about the inflationary threat. He may also believe that lower rates will stimulate growth and offset the depressant effect of his tariffs. Trump, in his second term, has also overlooked expertise and staffed the government with loyalists willing to fight all his fights and attack all his enemies with the vigor of Trump himself. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a hearing of the House Committee on Financial Services on Capitol Hill, Tuesday, June 24, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) · ASSOCIATED PRESS So Trump’s shadow chair would likely be somebody who parrots Trump’s claims that Powell is a “ numbskull ” and a “ dummy ” who doesn’t know what he’s doing. Every time Powell gives testimony or holds a press conference, the anti-Powell could hold his own public event, rebutting Powell and treating investors to frothy dreams of how much richer they’ll get once Powell is out of the way. Maybe the shadow chair will show up at Jackson Hole in August and heckle Powell during his annual economic speech . Drop Rick Newman a note , take his weekly economy quiz , or sign up for his newsletter . This all sounds kind of silly, but it may already be affecting markets. After Trump floated the idea of a shadow chair, market expectations changed from two Fed interest rate cuts this year to three, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool. Changing interest rate expectations can affect stock prices, since lower rates sometimes correlate with higher corporate profits. Frontrunners for the shadow job supposedly include Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, White House economist Kevin Hassett, Fed governor Chris Waller, and former Fed governor Kevin Warsh. Those are all pretty serious people not known for the kind of mudslinging Trump may be looking for. Bessent generally declines to say much about the Fed’s current policy, which is exactly what markets expect from a Treasury Secretary. The others have argued for a looser policy, but within the normal confines of respectful disagreement. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is more of a bomb-thrower willing to trash-talk the Fed, a la Trump. He recently posted a tweet explaining “ why President Trump calls Powell a loser ,” for anybody wanting a tutorial. But Lutnick is the bad cop to Bessent’s good cop, and investors would not find comfort in Lutnick’s barroom demeanor if he were in line for the Fed job. If Trump’s shadow chair spooked markets, it would be counterproductive. There’s also the small problem that the Fed chair isn’t a dictator unilaterally deciding whether to cut rates. There are 12 members of the Fed’s policymaking committee, each with one vote at each policymaking meeting. The chair can be influential, but not autocratic. Powell isn't even the most hawkish voting member, dead-set against rate cuts. He's more of a moderate lodged between hawks resisting rate cuts and doves who think the Fed should be cutting now or soon. As many analysts pointed out when Trump was talking about firing Powell earlier this year, a new chair would still leave the current policymaking board intact. Even Powell would stay. While his term as chairman expires in 2026, his term as a voting member of the policymaking committee runs to 2028. A shadow chair wouldn’t have any voting power until the Senate confirmed him or her to the job next May. The best such a person could do is amplify the chorus of voices vilifying Powell. Maybe that would be good enough for Trump. Rick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance . Follow him on Bluesky and X : @rickjnewman.

"Demand for new construction, long a housing market bright spot, is quickly weakening",2025-06-28 21:01:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/demand-for-new-construction-long-a-housing-market-bright-spot-is-quickly-weakening-120157646.html,"For years, homebuilders were relatively insulated from the deep slump the rest of the housing market faced. But now, they too are feeling the pinch of an underwhelming spring homebuying season — and scrambling to adjust. New home sales plummeted 14% in May from a month earlier as high prices, elevated mortgage rates, and economic concerns kept buyers away. Thirty-seven percent of builders reported cutting prices in June to help move a growing backlog of supply. Publicly traded homebuilders Lennar (LEN) and KB Home (KBH) both highlighted slower market conditions in their second quarter earnings reports. Many builders are now pulling back on future development plans. “Consumers grew increasingly apprehensive about the economy and rising geopolitical tensions, driving consumer confidence to a 13-year low. As a result, the housing market cooled,” KB Home President and COO Robert McGibney said Monday on a call to discuss earnings. The company cut prices in some markets in response, but the move hasn’t resonated with consumers. “Despite these actions, demand weakened,” he added. And now, homebuyers have more choices. Builders are sitting on the biggest pile of completed, unsold inventory since 2009 — and have the most single-family homes for sale since 2007. Meanwhile, existing home listings have spiked 30% from a year ago. In a growing number of markets, there are now more homes for sale than there have ever been before. But in most regions, neither new nor old homes are selling quickly. “The resale market has finally woken up, but woken up in a bad way, meaning a lot of supply but not too much demand,” said Rick Palacios Jr., director of research at John Burns Research and & Consulting, a housing market research firm. “It’s not a shocker that home builders are very quickly re-sizing their businesses.” Read more: 2025 housing market: Is it a good time to buy a house? Boom times end Builders are now cutting back after a boom period that started during the pandemic. Amid the homebuying frenzy of 2020 and 2021, they rushed to buy up land and construct new communities, especially in fast-growing, moderately priced parts of the country like the Southeast and Mountain West. At a time when older homes were scarce and bidding wars were common, the gambit worked: The S&P Homebuilders Select Industry Index surged 134% between October 2020 and October 2024, its peak. A dramatic jump in mortgage rates in the middle of 2022 cooled activity in the resale market, but builders found ways to maintain new home sales by buying down mortgage rates. If homebuyers looking at existing homes were finding rates about 7%, builders could offer temporary or permanent rate reductions to below 5% if buyers used an in-house or partner lender. They were also able to quickly adjust to market conditions by building smaller, cheaper homes. Read more: When will mortgage rates go back down to 6%? Recently, as mortgage rates and prices have stayed stubbornly high, new construction supply has begun exceeding demand. At first, inventory began to pile up in onetime pandemic relocation hotspots like Texas and Florida. But the weakness is now spreading throughout the country, Palacios said. Even builders in parts of the country like California, where housing supply is severely constrained, are now reporting a slowdown. The S&P homebuilder index has slumped 22% from its late 2024 peak. To keep homes moving now, builders are dangling bigger incentives to buyers. In Orlando, Fla., Realtor NyAsia Baker says rate buydown offers to 3.99% to 4.99% for the life of the loan are now common, when in years past those types of offers were temporary — only good for the first few years of a typical 30-year loan. Some builders are also offering up to $35,000 into so-called “flex cash,” which buyers can apply to closing costs or upgrades, compared with $5,000 or $10,000 a few years earlier. “Deals right now are kind of out of this world,” Baker said. She primarily works with buyers and stayed busy this spring as Orlando’s market shifted in their favor. “New construction incentives are definitely helping with that.” Many of Baker’s buyers come in open to considering new builds and existing homes, but end up choosing new construction for the deals. In Atlanta, Realtor Worrell Thomas has seen a similar pattern, especially among first-time buyers who often find themselves discouraged by the high prices and stubborn sellers they find on the resale market. “A lot of sellers right now are still stuck in the pandemic pricing,” Thomas said. Builders, meanwhile, are more willing to negotiate. “It’s definitely weak. They’re throwing all types of incentives out there to attract people to purchase,” he added. Read more: How to buy down your mortgage interest rate Sign up for the Mind Your Money weekly newsletter Subscribe By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Short-term deals, long-term shortage While today’s supply glut and incentives can mean cost savings for buyers now, they come with more troubling implications for the country’s longer-term housing supply. Housing economists estimate that the country has a shortage of somewhere between 1.5 million and 4.5 million homes. And with demand weak now, builders aren’t rushing to start new construction processes like acquiring more pricey land and working with local governments to secure building permits. Housing starts plunged to a five-year low in May, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.25 million homes. Building permits, a preliminary step in the construction process, were also down. “It’s definitely not what we love to see,” said Hannah Jones, senior economic research analyst at Realtor.com. “In the medium to long term, we’re not likely to see home prices come down much and affordability improve much on a national scale.” There’s little evidence that builders will change their tone anytime soon. Builder confidence in June sank to the lowest level in over two years, with reviews of the current sales environment, sales expectations for the next six months, and prospective buyer traffic all falling, according to data tracked by the National Association of Home Builders and Wells Fargo. Slower market conditions in second quarter: A Lennar housing project, under construction. (AP Photo/Paul Sakuma) · ASSOCIATED PRESS But for now, homebuilder pain means bigger discounts for buyers. KB Home cut the high end of its expected average selling price this year, while Lennar said its average prices had hit a five-year low. Erin Hill, 27, and her husband recently closed on a new construction home in Fort Worth, Texas. They initially looked into existing homes in Denton, where they're from, but found their budget limited them to fixer-uppers, which they hoped to avoid. After seeing new construction deals online and hearing from a friend who purchased a new build, they expanded their search into those communities, ultimately landing on a 2,100-square-foot, 3-bedroom, 2.5-bathroom home built by Lennar — which bought their mortgage rate down to 4.25% for the life of the loan, offered them free appliances and window blinds, and paid for their closing costs. ""For us financially, it made the most sense,"" Hill said. Recently, she's been keeping track of the other homes for sale on her street to see when they might be welcoming new neighbors. She's watched some listings linger for a month or longer, and Lennar cut prices in response. ""A lot of the houses on the street were up for week after week after week,"" she said. ""They would knock the prices down and down. They just want them sold."" Claire Boston is a Senior Reporter for Yahoo Finance covering housing, mortgages, and home insurance.

The tech rally is about a lot more than Magnificent 7 right now,2025-06-28 19:00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-tech-rally-is-about-a-lot-more-than-magnificent-7-right-now-100031363.html,"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings The broadening of the AI trade is here. One of the most common calls among Wall Street strategists entering the year was for the AI trade to expand further from seven key popular players into a slew of other areas of the market. Since the April 8 market bottom, it's been happening. AI chip and data center trades not named Nvidia ( NVDA ) have been among the S&P 500's ( ^GSPC ) best performers, with Broadcom ( AVGO ), AMD ( AMD ), and Dell ( DELL ) up roughly 70% or more in that timeframe. The AI energy trade has taken off too, with Vistra Corp ( VST ) and NRG Energy ( NRG ) up more than 80%. The AI cloud trade has emerged as well, with Oracle ( ORCL ) up more than 70% and trading at an all-time high. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Morning Brief Subscribe By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy To be fair, some of the ""Magnificent Seven"" have also risen off the bottom. Nvidia has led the pack, rising over 60% to recently notch a new all-time high. But as our Chart of the Week shows, none of the Magnificent Seven have outperformed the other AI stocks that are among the top 20 best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 since the market bottom. After two years of there only being a few large-cap tech names in town , investors looking to outperform the market during the massive run higher of the past two months have had more success looking beyond the most popular stocks of the current bull market. This reveals a common truth about bull markets. They're about themes, not individual stocks. In the 1920s, the bull market was defined by surging demand for radio communications and automobiles. The dot-com bubble that ran in the late 1990s was, of course, focused on the initial hype of the internet. But after rising more than 270% from 1995 to the end of 1996, Cisco ( CSCO ), the poster child of the era , wasn't among the market's top 10 performers come 1997 to 1999. The theme stayed, but the best-performing stocks in the market oscillated. If you listen closely, that's what many on Wall Street have been saying for a while now. It's an AI and tech bull market, not the ""Magnificent Seven"" bull market. Whatever it's called, it's certainly ongoing and has ""further to run, as Julian Emanuel, who leads the equity, derivatives, and quantitative strategy team at Evercore ISI, wrote this week in a note to clients. ""Despite the near-term uncertainty,"" he wrote, ""the four elements that end bull markets [a recession, Fed hikes, spiking bond yields, and extreme stock valuations] are all absent.""

"The biggest US banks pass another Fed stress test, boosting case for looser capital rules",2025-06-28 05:51:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-biggest-us-banks-pass-another-fed-stress-test-boosting-case-for-looser-capital-rules-203003029.html,"The Federal Reserve’s latest stress tests show that the largest US banks could withstand a severe recession with plenty of capital on hand to absorb hundreds of billions in losses. This year the Fed's regulatory exam applied to 22 banks with assets of more than $100 billion, a group that included Wall Street giants such as JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ), Bank of America ( BAC ), Citigroup ( C ), Wells Fargo ( WFC ), Goldman Sachs ( GS ), and Morgan Stanley ( MS ).

All 22 lenders were able to show that their capital levels would stay above a key threshold in a scenario where GDP contracts by nearly 8%, unemployment soars to 10%, home prices plunge 33%, and the stock market drops by 50%. Their common equity tier 1 capital ratio as a group was 11.6%, well above the required minimum of 4.5%. The banks' losses in this simulation also collectively amounted to more than $550 billion. That included $148 billion from credit card losses, $124 billion from business loans, and $52 billion from commercial real estate. The passing grade for all banks could help the Trump administration make its case that it is time to loosen rules for financial institutions as it implements a deregulatory agenda it hopes will boost lending and drive economic growth. Earlier this week, US regulators proposed one of the most dramatic rollbacks of bank capital rules since the 2008 financial crisis as they suggested altering the so-called enhanced supplementary leverage ratio (eSLR). Banks have complained that this ratio penalizes them for holding lower-risk assets such as Treasury bonds. Michelle Bowman, the Fed's vice chair for supervision. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) · ASSOCIATED PRESS More regulatory changes for big banks could still be on the way. Bowman, the Fed's top banking regulator appointed by Trump, made it clear in a speech Monday that revisiting the eSLR requirement is just the start of broader capital rollback considerations. ""More work on capital requirements remains, especially to consider how they have evolved and whether changes in market conditions have revealed issues that should be addressed,"" she said. Other capital requirements under consideration for adjustment include the surcharge on global systemically important banks and the asset thresholds that define how strict regulatory standards are for each institution. On July 22, the Fed will host a conference to bring together leaders to discuss the capital framework for US banks. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has asked the administration to consider a broad set of changes. Among the biggest Wall Street banks, JPMorgan had the highest level of capital under the Fed's stressed scenario. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) · Tom Williams via Getty Images ""We expect to see additional regulatory relief measures announced for the banking industry in the coming months,” said RBC banking analyst Gerard Cassidy. “Regulatory relief will likely lead to higher bank profitability and increased merger and acquisition activity."" The Fed tests were first mandated annually by law following the 2008 financial crisis as a way of assessing the stability of the nation's giant lenders. There will also likely be changes to these Fed tests in future years. The Fed is seeking public input on the models used to determine the hypothetical losses and revenue of banks under stress, and it will use that feedback to make improvements going forward. Banks showed a smaller decline in capital under the stressed scenario this year than in years past, which the Fed says is due to volatility in the models and milder deterioration in the economy. Loan losses were also lower this year. Lenders typically use the results of the annual Fed tests to determine how much they should have on their balance sheet to absorb shocks and how much they have left over for dividends and buybacks. The Fed has asked banks not to make announcements about how much money they plan to return to shareholders until early next week. In a note earlier this week, Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo indicated that good stress test scores for the biggest banks would give a “green light” for these lenders “to deploy more capital for loans, deals, and buybacks.” Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"
"Nike stock soars 15% as company forecasts smaller sales, profit drops while tariff costs near $1 billion",2025-06-28 05:07:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nike-stock-soars-15-as-company-forecasts-smaller-sales-profit-drops-while-tariff-costs-near-1-billion-200709357.html,"Nike ( NKE ) stock soared on Friday after the sneaker giant said its profit and sales declines would narrow in the current quarter, while costs from tariffs are expected to approach $1 billion as the company makes additional moves to diversify its supply chain away from China. Nike said Thursday it expects sales to be down by mid-single digits in the current quarter following a 12% drop in revenue during its fiscal fourth quarter ended May 31. Gross margins fell by 440 basis points, or 4.4%, in its fourth quarter and are forecast to fall by 350-425 basis points in the current quarter. Shares rose 15.2% on Friday, bringing Nike's year-to-date losses to less than 5%; in early April, Nike stock was down 30% in 2025 alone. Read more about Nike's stock moves and today's market action. On its conference call with investors late Thursday, Nike CFO Matthew Friend said newly implemented US tariffs ""represent a new and meaningful cost headwind."" Nike expects a 100 basis point negative impact on its gross margins as a result of tariffs. Friend added the company sees a ""gross incremental cost increase to Nike of approximately $1 billion,"" adding, ""We intend to fully mitigate the impact of these headwinds over time."" On Thursday, Nike said it plans to cut its reliance on China for manufacturing the goods it sells in the US as part of this strategy. Chinese suppliers currently account for about 16% of the shoes it imports into the US, and the company said on its earnings call that it expects to bring that down to ""high single-digit range"" by the end of this fiscal year. The company also announced plans for a ""surgical price increase"" in the US, which is set to begin this fall. Read more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet Nike has been challenged by the sweeping tariffs announced by President Trump earlier this year, with those impacts still uncertain given its global operational footprint and exposure both to China and Vietnam. The company has been diversifying its manufacturing base since Trump's first term in office. In 2024, it produced 18% of its apparel and 16% of footwear in China, compared to 26% and 29%, respectively, in 2016. Nike's struggles in China have also continued, with revenue falling 20% in the region last quarter, driven by a footwear and apparel sales decline of 20% and 19%, respectively. For its fiscal fourth quarter, ended May 31, Nike reported revenue of $11.1 billion, a 12% decline that was lower than Wall Street forecasts for a nearly 15% decline to $10.72 billion, according to Bloomberg data. Adjusted earnings per share tallied $0.14, compared to the forecast $0.13 per share. That was far lower than the $1.01 per share in earnings it reported in the same quarter last year. Same-store sales at Nike-owned stores ticked higher, rising 2% compared to the 2.6% decline analysts anticipated. ""While our financial results are in line with our expectations, they are not where we want them to be. Moving forward, we expect our business to improve as a result of the progress we're making,"" CEO Elliott Hill said in the release. Alongside the tariffs headwinds, Nike is also facing deteriorating consumer confidence as it aims to get customers back in stores and competes with rivals like On ( ONON ) and Hoka ( DECK ). Nike stock is still down over 6% this year with Friday's surge but has rebounded sharply from its April 8 lows, the day before President Trump paused his most dramatic tariffs announced on ""Liberation Day."" The company is also banking on certain innovations like the launch of Vomero 18, Jordan Retros, A'One, and a collaboration with Kim Kardashian. Nike is also patching up its wholesale partnerships with the likes of Dick's Sporting Goods ( DKS ) and Macy's ( M ) after it decided to focus on its direct-to-consumer business.

But as we've pointed out in the past, just because valuations are high doesn't mean they can't stay high for an extended period of time . It also doesn't mean they can't keep moving higher. The chart below from Exhibit A co-founder Matt Cerminaro shows that when splitting the S&P 500 into deciles organized by least and most expensive, the current market is far less expensive than the peak of the 2021 stock boom. For instance, the average stock in the most expensive bucket is trading at a 63 times forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio, well below the 104 times forward earnings seen back in 2021. ""Price earnings multiples are a function of investor confidence, which is a constantly moving target and has very little in the way of natural limits on either the upside or downside,"" DataTrek co-founder Nicholas Colas wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. The S&P 500's most recent record close comes as the market has rallied more than 23% from its April 8 bottom. Now, strategists believe the market's largest tariff fears are behind investors. Economic forecasts have once again begun reverting higher , along with projections for corporate earnings this year. And Wall Street strategists are becoming incrementally bullish on the outlook from here. No fewer than 11 Wall Street firms lowered their S&P 500 targets amid the market sell-off in April. At least eight of those have since raised their bets on where the index will end 2025. The latest was BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski, who raised his year-end target to 6,700 from 6,100 on Tuesday . ""The signposts we called out in April are largely in place – markets are transitioning TO 'show me' FROM 'scare me,""' Belski wrote. ""We believe performance is broadening, reactions from daily rhetoric are calming, and actual corporate guidance will increase coming out of the 2Q earnings reporting period.""

"Stock market today: S&P 500, Nasdaq notch record closes, brushing off renewed trade tensions",2025-06-28 06:15:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-sp-500-nasdaq-notch-record-closes-brushing-off-renewed-trade-tensions-200031630.html,"US stocks recovered on Friday afternoon to clinch fresh records despite renewed trade tensions after President Trump said he was terminating talks with Canada . The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) closed at an all-time high for the first time since February. The benchmark index was trading near record territory for much of the session over optimism on the trade front — the US and China clinching a trade truce — and hopes of a rate cut from the Fed sooner rather than later. The Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) also notched a record high. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) gained 1%, or about 400 points. Stocks temporarily took a dramatic turn after Trump posted on social media that he was ""terminating ALL discussions on Trade with Canada, effective immediately,"" citing Canada's digital services tax as the cause. He said he would set a new tariff rate on Canadian goods within the next week. Markets had gotten a boost on the trade front on Friday after Trump said that the US and China have ""signed"" a trade deal . The two sides have cemented the tariff truce sealed last month in Geneva, and China has confirmed details of the agreed trade framework, per several media reports. Under the pact, China has committed to delivering rare earth minerals to the US, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Bloomberg. Once that is underway, “we’ll take down our countermeasures,” he said. Also on Friday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Friday said the US could complete the balance of its most important trade talks by Labor Day, raising hopes that the US wouldn't be firm on its July 9 tariff deadline. Meanwhile, the Fed's rate path also remained in focus. The latest reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge showed price increases accelerated in May as inflation remained above the Fed's 2% target. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has stressed that an uptick in price pressures could be a stumbling block to a rate cut. That report also contained signs of an economic slowdown, however, which could further complicate the emerging debate between Fed hawks and doves.

Trump added, ""Can it start again? I guess someday it can. It could maybe start soon."" Shares of Palantir had soared in early June after announcing a new $463 million contract to provide its AI software to the US Special Operations Command within the US military. The stock continued to rise after Israel first carried out airstrikes on Iran on June 12 and after the US carried out its own bombings on Iran’s nuclear sites later in the month. Palantir provides its AI software to the Israeli Defense Force. “Shares of PLTR did seem to benefit from the tension and conflict in the Middle East, so with more quiet outlook for the region, PLTR may be giving some of those gains back,” DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance. In addition to the ceasefire between Israel and Iran, The Washington Post reports that there is a renewed push between Arab mediators and Israeli hostage families to negotiate an end to Israel's war on Gaza. The drop also comes a day after protesters rallied outside of Palantir’s Palo Alto offices to oppose the company’s work with ICE amid Trump’s sweeping deportations. In other news for Palantir, the company announced Thursday that it’s partnering with a nuclear power company, The Nuclear Company , to develop AI software to help build plants “faster and safer.” Fri, June 27, 2025 at 4:46 PM UTC Laura Bratton Chip stocks set to see growing benefit from rising AI spending, JPMorgan says JPMorgan analysts said in a report following a survey of 168 chief information officers that artificial intelligence spending is set to jump over the next three years, with positive implications for chip stocks. According to the survey, AI-related computing hardware as a percentage of CIOs' IT budgets is set to rise to 15.9% in three years from 5.9% currently, the analysts wrote. “The survey results support our view of a strong multi-year spending cycle in the AI infrastructure build-out and should continue to support sustained strong revenue growth for the AI beneficiaries,” the report said. Those beneficiaries include chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ), Broadcom ( AVGO ), Marvell Technology ( MRVL ), Micron ( MU ), Arm ( ARM ), and Nvidia ( NVDA ), as well as producers of high-performance networking products for AI data centers such as Astera Labs ( ALAB ).

The AI chipmaker and Microsoft have seen their market capitalizations balloon to nearly $4 trillion. “We believe both Nvidia and Microsoft will hit the $4 trillion market cap club this summer and then over the next 18 months the focus will be on the $5 trillion club ... as this tech bull market is still early being led by the AI Revolution,” Wedbush’s Dan Ives wrote in a note to investors on Friday. Nvidia’s market cap stood at $3.86 trillion Friday, while Microsoft’s was $3.71 trillion. Amazon ( AMZN ) on Friday entered positive territory for the year for the first time since February, up roughly 0.2% in 2025 as of midday Friday.

Gianarikas said it would take only 411,000 robotaxis to replace all Uber and Lyft drivers in the US. “Now, we are not sure it all happens that quickly, but there is very much a non-zero probability that it does.” While the platforms have been integrating robotaxis into their offerings — for example, Uber has partnered with Waymo, and Lyft with Mobileye and others — Gianarikas said that “hybrid” approach may not help them in a future robotaxi-dominated market. ""The challenge for UberLyft is how long a hybrid network will stay relevant, and then what value they can add over the long-term in a new paradigm,"" he wrote. ""The future could be bright: value added in the AV world through hybrid human-robot networks, strong on the ground operations, and other tactical elements,"" he added.

"Nvidia's stark turnaround is being powered by robots, hyperscalers, and sovereign AI",2025-06-28 05:00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidias-stark-turnaround-is-being-powered-by-robots-hyperscalers-and-sovereign-ai-200015463.html,"Nvidia ( NVDA ) is riding a wave of AI enthusiasm that has sent its stock price soaring to new highs after being battered in the early part of the year on fears of new AI models out of China and tariff threats. On Friday, shares of Nvidia hit $157, up from $94 in April, marking a stunning turnaround for the world's leading AI chip company. The moves can be attributed to a number of factors turning in Nvidia's favor, including the successful ramp of the buildout of its Blackwell chip line, the explosion in interest around so-called sovereign AI, and the company's push into what it calls physical AI, or robotics. Nvidia's Blackwell ramp, the process of building out chips and increasing overall volume, has been a major win for the company. During its GTC Paris event earlier this month, Nvidia said it is now shipping 1,000 Grace Blackwell (GB200) server racks per week and is on track for its transition to its next-generation Blackwell Ultra-powered GB300 servers. Getting its chips and servers out the door as fast as possible has been key for Nvidia, especially after earlier delays as the company began to ramp production of Blackwell chips in late 2024. Nvidia said the GB300 line of chips will be able to slot directly into GB200 servers, which the company claims will make it easier for its customers to upgrade to its latest offerings. Nvidia also continues to benefit from the seemingly insatiable demand for its chips from hyperscalers, including Amazon ( AMZN ), Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Meta ( META ), and xAI, among others. According to CFO Colette Kress, large cloud service providers accounted for just under 50% of the company's data center sales in its fiscal first quarter . And with hyperscalers expected to spend billions more on their AI buildouts in the coming months, there's little reason to believe that will slow down anytime soon. CEO Jensen Huang is also betting big on the idea of sovereign AI, or AI data centers built in specific countries to power their own AI needs. Huang was on hand during President Trump's visit to the Middle East in May, during which Trump announced that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) will be able to purchase thousands of Nvidia chips for their data centers. One of those projects, the UAE's Project Stargate, could include 100,000 Nvidia GPUs, according to Reuters . Huang also touted sovereign AI plans for Europe during GTC Paris. ""The company is establishing AI technology centers in Germany, Sweden, Italy, Spain, UK, and Finland, and working with regional cloud and telco partners in France, UK, and Germany to build new AI datacenters with [tens] of thousands of Grace Blackwell systems and GPUs,"" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in an investor note following the event. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivers his keynote address on June 11, 2025, at the Vivatech fair in Paris. (AP Photo/Michel Euler) · ASSOCIATED PRESS ""They are planning for 20 AI factories to be deployed in Europe, several at gigawatt scale, and sees European compute capacity growing by a factor of 10x over the next 2 years,"" Rasgon added. Huang and company also continue to push further into physical AI, with the CEO calling it a multitrillion-dollar opportunity. Physical AI is another way of referring to the software and computers needed to power things like humanoid robots and self-driving cars. Nvidia offers both chips and the training information needed to run robots in factories and has been working in the automotive industry for years on self-driving car technologies. But don't expect to have a robot walking around your home anytime soon. Those kinds of bipedal butlers are likely years away from being something you can grab at your local Best Buy. Importantly, Nvidia has managed to shake off fears over the Trump administration's ban on sales of its chips to China. Despite taking a hefty charge on canceled orders, Wall Street analysts are more upbeat on the issue now that the ban is official and they no longer have to question whether one is coming or not. After all, there's comfort in certainty. Of course, Nvidia still faces the prospect of competition from rivals like AMD ( AMD ). And its own customers, including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, are building or currently using their own in-house chips to take on Nvidia's offerings, making for a more complicated relationship. For now, however, Nvidia is rolling into summer with the wind at its back. Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. · yahoofinance Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

'We can do whatever we want': Trump sows confusion on his summer tariff timeline,2025-06-29 21:50:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/we-can-do-whatever-we-want-trump-sows-confusion-on-his-summer-tariff-timeline-182901280.html,"The market's task of planning for how tariff developments will play out this summer got more complicated Friday as President Trump and his team offered a host of options for what to expect in the months ahead. First, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent raised eyebrows when he suggested that his focus could be on an end-of-summer deadline, saying, ""I think we could have trade wrapped up by Labor Day."" But any hopes for a summer lull between now and then were short-lived when, just a few hours later, Trump offered multiple other scenarios during a wide-ranging press conference. At one point, the president reiterated his plan to send letters to dictate tariff rates for at least some countries, perhaps as soon as next week, saying, ""It's going to go very quickly."" Minutes later, he said that a July 9 deadline to raise ""reciprocal"" tariffs is not set and perhaps could move, but in an unpredictable direction. ""We can do whatever we want,"" he told reporters of that deadline. ""We could extend it, we could make it shorter,"" adding that his preference was to make it shorter. Trump then capped things off with a social media post in the early afternoon announcing he was ""terminating ALL discussions on Trade with Canada, effective immediately"" over digital taxes. ""We will let Canada know the Tariff that they will be paying to do business with the United States of America within the next seven day period,"" he added. The issue for Trump on this front appears to be a 3% tax on technology companies that Canada implemented a year ago but set to start collecting payments on Monday on technology companies operating in Canada and doing things like collecting user data. Later Friday afternoon, Trump linked the issue with similar taxes on technology companies in Europe, which have long rankled the president. He suggested Canada was copying Europe and said ""we have such power over Canada"" suggesting to reporters that Canada could restart talks by removing the tax. President Trump answers questions during a press conference in the briefing room at the White House on June 27. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images) · Joe Raedle via Getty Images It all comes as the administration faces a series of deadlines in the weeks ahead, from that July 9 date to strike ""reciprocal"" trade deals to an early August deadline for progress with China and Bessent's new end-of-summer deadline to wrap things up. The immediate effect of Trump's surprise announcement on Canada, which pushed stocks slightly down and off record high levels , was unclear, with the president saying new tariffs there could be coming in a week's time but with overall talks with America's closest neighbors on yet another track. The key date in those talks with both Canada and Mexico are often focuses on next summer, when the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) faces a renewal deadline. Read more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet 'Markets shouldn't assume there's only one direction' Terry Haines of Pangaea Policy summed up the many scenarios in a note to Yahoo Finance (before Trump's Canada post). ""Markets are right to assume that bilateral trade deals are on a positive track ... but markets shouldn't assume there's only one direction trade/tariffs can go,"" Haines said, adding that plenty of things could go south in the days and weeks ahead. Henrietta Treyz of Veda Partners added her own bottom line for the next few weeks, saying ""the best investors and consumers can hope for beyond July 9th is an extension of the current 10% tariff rates,"" with potential increases potentially delayed as Trump and his team acknowledge they need more time. But that could mean that, as both Trump and Treyz noted on Friday, perhaps the most likely immediate-term development is these long-promised letters from Trump to lower-level trading partners simply setting new rates. As Treyz wrote, her forecast remains that ""about 135 nations will simply be advised of their new tariff rates, which I suspect will land in the 10%-25% range, the major trading partners will announce robust enough deals in principle or frameworks for continued negotiations that will allow the White House to build an off ramp to avoid higher tariff rates for most countries."" Greg Valliere of AGF Investments added ""They’ll be lucky to get a few deals done by July 4. Maybe a few more in August but the bulk these deals may not get done until deep into the fall."" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent attends the press conference held by President Trump in the briefing room at the White House on June 27. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images) · Joe Raedle via Getty Images The developments come near the end of a June that saw relatively fewer developments on the trade front, with Trump often more focused on issues like geopolitics, immigration, and his tax bill. The month also saw US coffers set to see another monthly record for tariff revenue , with more than $26.7 billion in evidence so far for June. Tariffs also remain central to economic projections and could rise, added EY chief economist Gregory Daco in a Yahoo Finance appearance as he warned that a new rise in tariffs could accelerate inflation and impact consumer spending through the rest of 2025. ""We are going to see a tariff reacceleration that is going to be tariff-induced,"" he said of the months ahead, adding, ""There's more pressure to come into the economy."" Read more: Why tariffs are expected to increase car insurance costs Progress with China The flood of White House trade commentary also came as Trump and his team continued to tout — and overstate what is publicly known, at least — his limited existing deals with China and the UK. The US and China did move forward this week and inked their recently agreed-upon ""framework"" to move forward on talks. Trump announced that move on Thursday, which Chinese state media later confirmed . Both nations are looking to get into trade talks in earnest in the weeks ahead and move past a few pressing short-term issues like rare earth minerals and semiconductor export controls. The move this week does further stabilize trade relations, but an array of unresolved trading issues between the world's two largest economies remains outstanding. Bessent confirmed one of them on Friday during his appearance on Fox Business Network's ""Mornings With Maria."" He confirmed that this week's step forward with China does not include any change in tariff rates, noting, ""Now our tariffs are 30 on them [and] we're collecting a substantial tariff income."" As Haines put it in all caps in a note to clients, ""THERE.IS.NO.NEW.TRADE.DEAL.WITH.CHINA,"" suggesting investors shouldn't react too strongly on that front.

"Fed rate cut and tech boom could lift markets but a choppy summer still looms, analyst warns",2025-06-28 03:28:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-rate-cut-and-tech-boom-could-lift-markets-but-a-choppy-summer-still-looms-analyst-warns-182802984.html,"After a roller-coaster first half for US stocks, investors hoping for smooth sailing in the back half of 2025 should hold off on celebrating. Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist, says the technical picture remains bullish, but valuations are stretched, and seasonal volatility could test investor resolve before year-end. “I think the bias is still high,” Lerner said on Yahoo Finance’s Opening Bid . “I think you still want to position for that, and we’re focused more on some of these growth areas.” The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) is trading near 22x forward P/E, the top end of its range from recent years. While July is historically a solid month, “August and September tend to be a little more challenging,” he said. Year to date, the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite ( ^IXIC ) have both jumped around 5%. AI hype has driven Big Tech stocks like Nvidia ( NVDA ) to record highs. Yet despite the tech gains, markets have largely traded sideways for seven months. Lerner noted that while the tech breakout is encouraging, investors should perform ""gut checks"" along the way. Long-term investors should stay in the market but keep expectations in check, especially as valuations near their ceiling. A softening Fed, steady economic data, and robust earnings from key sectors still underpin the bull case. “We still like growth areas, tech, semiconductors, communication services, and we’re starting to add a bit more international exposure,” Lerner said. Layered on top of seasonal chop and valuation anxiety is a steady drip of geopolitical uncertainty, including ongoing tensions in the Middle East. But investors may be overestimating the impact of these on the market. According to a new Barclays report, spikes in geopolitical risk have had little observable impact on US equity returns over the past three decades. The S&P 500 has historically shrugged off periods of unrest, with six-month returns staying largely in line with long-run averages after spikes in risk. At the sector level, industrials tend to outperform after geopolitical shocks, while energy stocks typically lag, a trend that might be unexpected for investors adopting a defensive strategy. However, geopolitical spikes are rarely a reason to abandon equities, per the report. Francisco Velasquez is an associate reporter at Yahoo Finance. He can be reached on LinkedIn and X .

Microsoft ( MSFT ), Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ), Meta ( META ), and Amazon ( AMZN ) continue to debut new AI-powered software capabilities while leaders from other AI firms split off to form their own startups. But the furious pace of change also makes it difficult to keep track of the various players in the AI space. With that in mind, we're breaking down what you need to know about the biggest names in AI and what they do. From OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) to Perplexity ( PEAI.PVT ), these are the AI companies you should be following. OpenAI/Microsoft Microsoft-backed OpenAI helped put generative AI technology on the map. The company's ChatGPT bot , released in late 2022, quickly became one of the most downloaded apps in the world. Since then, the company has launched its own search engine, 4o image generator, a video generator, and a file uploader that allows you to ask the bot to summarize the content of your documents, as well as access to specialized first- and third-party GPT bots. Microsoft uses OpenAI's various large language models (LLM) in its Copilot and other services . Apple ( AAPL ) also offers access to ChatGPT as part of its Apple Intelligence and Visual Intelligence services .

(AP Photo/Barbara Ortutay) · ASSOCIATED PRESS But there's drama behind the scenes. OpenAI is working to restructure its business into a public benefit corporation overseen by its nonprofit arm, which will allow it to raise more capital. To do that, it needs Microsoft's sign-off, but the two sides are at loggerheads over the details of the plan and what it means for each company. In the meantime, both OpenAI and Microsoft are reportedly working on products that will compete with each other's existing offerings. Microsoft offers its own AI models , and OpenAI is developing a productivity service, according to The Information . Still, the pairing has been lucrative for both tech firms. During its most recent quarterly earnings call, Microsoft said AI revenue was above expectations and contributed 16 percentage points of growth for the company’s Azure cloud business. OpenAI, meanwhile, saw its annualized revenue run rate balloon to $10 billion as of June, according to Reuters . That's up from $5.5 billion in Dec. 2024. OpenAI offers a limited free version of its ChatGPT bot, as well as ChatGPT Plus, which costs $20 per month, and enterprise versions of the app. Google Gemini Google's Gemini offers search functionality using the company's Gemini 2.5 family of AI models. You can choose between using Gemini Flash for quick searches or Gemini Pro, which is meant for deep research and coding. Gemini doesn't just power Google's Gemini app. It's pervasive across Google's litany of services. Checking your email or prepping an outline in Docs , Gemini is there. Get an AI Overviews result when using standard Google Search ? That’s Gemini too. Google Maps ? That also takes advantage of Gemini. Chrome, YouTube, Google Flights, Google Hotels — you name it, it's using Gemini. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai speaks at a Google I/O event in Mountain View, Calif., on May 20, 2025. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) · ASSOCIATED PRESS But Google's Gemini, previously known as Bard, got off to a rough start. When Google debuted its Gemini-powered AI Overviews in May 2024, it began offering up wild statements like recommending users put glue on their pizza to help make the cheese stick. But during its I/O developer conference in May, Google showed off a number of impressive new developments for Gemini, including its updated video-generation software Veo 3 and Gemini running on prototype smart glasses . A limited version of Gemini is available to use for free. A paid tier that costs $19.99 per month gives you access to advanced AI models and integration with Google's productivity suite. A $249 subscription lets you use Google's most advanced Gemini models and 30TB of storage via Google Drive, Photos, and Gmail. Meta Mark Zuckerberg's Meta has gone through a number of transformations over the years, from desktops to mobile to short-form video to an ill-advised detour into the metaverse. Now the company is leaning heavily into AI with the goal of dominating the space so it doesn't have to rely on technologies from rivals like Apple and Google, like it did during the smartphone wars. It helps that Meta has a massive $70 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand that it can deploy at a moment’s notice and data from billions of users to train its models. Meta chief product officer Chris Cox speaks at LlamaCon 2025, an AI developer conference, in Menlo Park, Calif., on April 29, 2025. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) · ASSOCIATED PRESS Unlike most competitors, Meta is offering its Llama family of AI models as open-weights software , which means companies and researchers can adjust the models as they see fit, though they don't get access to the original training data. More people developing apps and tools that use Llama means Meta effectively gets to see how its software can evolve without having to do extra work. But Llama 4 Behemoth, the company's massive LLM, has been delayed by months, according to the Wall Street Journal . To seemingly offset similar delays moving forward, Meta is scooping up AI talent left and right . The company invested $14.3 billion in Scale AI and hired its CEO, Alexandr Wang. Meta also grabbed Safe Superintelligence CEO Daniel Gross and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman. Meta's AI, like Google's, runs across its various platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, as well as its smart glasses. Anthropic Founded in 2021 by siblings and ex-OpenAI researchers Dario and Daniela Amodei, Anthropic ( ANTH.PVT ) is an AI company focused on safety and trust. The duo split off from OpenAI over disagreements related to AI safety and the company's general direction. Like OpenAI, Anthropic has accumulated some deep-pocketed backers, including Amazon and Google , which have already poured billions into the company. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei at the Code with Claude developer conference on May 22, 2025, in San Francisco. (Don Feria/AP Content Services for Anthropic) · ASSOCIATED PRESS The company's Claude models are available across various cloud services. Its Anthropic chat interface offers a host of capabilities, including web searches, coding, as well as writing and drafting documents. Anthropic also allows users to build what it calls artifacts, which are documents, games, lists, and other bite-sized pieces of content you can share online. In June, a federal judge sided with Anthropic in a case in which the company was accused of breaking copyright law by training its models on copyrighted books. But Anthropic allegedly downloaded pirated versions of some books and will now face trial over the charge. xAI Elon Musk's xAI, a separate company from X Corp, which owns X (formerly Twitter), offers its own Grok chatbot and Grok AI models. Users can access Grok through a website, app, and X. Like other AI services, it allows users to search for information via the web, generate text and images, and write code. The company trains Grok on its Colossus supercomputer, which xAI said will eventually include 1 million GPUs. The Grok logo with a person holding a phone in their hand. (Klaudia Radecka/NurPhoto via Getty Images) · NurPhoto via Getty Images According to Musk, Grok was meant to have an edgy flair, though like other chatbots, it has been caught spreading misinformation. Musk previously co-founded OpenAI with Sam Altman but left the company after disagreements over its future and leadership positions. In 2024, Musk filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Sam Altman over the AI company's effort to restructure itself as a for-profit organization . Musk says OpenAI has abandoned its original mission statement to build AI to benefit humanity and instead is working to enrich itself and Microsoft. Perplexity Perplexity takes a real-time web search approach to AI chatbots, serving as a true threat to the likes of Google and its own search engine. Headed by CEO Aravind Srinivas, who previously worked as a research scientist at OpenAI, Perplexity allows users to choose from a number of different AI models, including OpenAI's GPT-4.1, Anthropic's Claude 4.0 Sonnet, Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro, xAI's Grok 3, and the company's own Sonoar. Perplexity also provides users with Discover pages for topics like finance, sports, and more, with stories curated by both the Perplexity team and outside contractors. As with other AI companies, Perplexity has been criticized by media organizations for allegedly using their content without permission. Dow Jones is suing the company over the practice .

"Foreign stocks are crushing US shares, even with the new record high",2025-06-28 00:57:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/foreign-stocks-are-crushing-us-shares-even-with-the-new-record-high-155708202.html,"American investors are pumped about a new record high in the S&P 500 stock index . Meh. It’s actually not much to brag about. South Korean stocks also hit new highs recently, and they’re up 37% so far this year. German stocks are up 28%. Mexican stocks, up 27%. The gain in Hong Kong is 20%. All foreign stocks combined are up about 15%. The big 2025 gain American stock investors are celebrating? A paltry 5%. That modest gain is obviously better than the dismal April sell-off that followed President Trump’s April 2 announcement of sweeping “reciprocal tariffs” on imports from dozens of countries. Within a few days of that depressing news, US stocks were down 16% for the year. Trump blinked and postponed most of those tariffs till July 9. There’s a good chance he’ll postpone the deadline again as it draws nigh. The US stock market has clawed back Trump-induced losses as Trump has modulated his tariff demands. When Trump took office in January, the average tax on imports was around 2.5%. The reciprocal tariffs would have raised that to around 28%, high enough to force price hikes on millions of consumers, dent corporate profits, and possibly cause a recession. While Trump postponed the reciprocal tariffs, he left in place a bunch of others, including a new baseline tariff of 10% on most imports; a 30% tax on most Chinese imports; additional tariffs on steel, aluminum, automotive products and a few other things. The average tariff is now around 15%. Read more: 5 ways to tariff-proof your finances US stocks got back into positive territory for the year in May, and they’ve drifted upward since then. Investors have basically decided they can live with the Trump tariffs as they are now. Growth will be slower and inflation higher, but investors’ collective assessment is that the public companies that comprise the US stock market will largely be able to protect their profit margins. Yet the longstanding allure of American stocks has vanished during Trump’s second term. “The first half of 2025 is a case study on why investors should consider international diversification,” investing firm Charles Schwab advised in a recent analysis . “US stocks have underperformed international stocks so far this year amid unpredictable and uncertain policy moves in the U.S. The second half of the year may see continued volatility and international stock market leadership could remain a trend.” NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JUNE 23: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during morning trading on June 23, 2025 in New York City. Stocks opened slightly up as the market reacts to the U.S. striking three nuclear sites in Iran over the weekend, raising fears of an increase in oil prices. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) · Michael M. Santiago via Getty Images Drop Rick Newman a note , take his weekly economy quiz , or sign up for his newsletter . Trump says foreign countries pay his tariffs, which is patently untrue. Investors know that, part of the reason US stocks are floundering. American importers pay the tariffs to the US government the moment they receive a foreign shipment. Those businesses bear the cost of the higher tariffs right away. Then they pass on as much of the higher cost to their own customers as possible, all the way to ordinary consumers. From March through May, the US government collected $46 billion in import taxes , 283% more than during the same period in 2024. Trump’s tariffs could easily bring in an additional $300 billion per year. Administration officials brag about the new revenue the tariffs are bringing in , but they don’t bother to point out that these taxes raise costs for American businesses and consumers. The US stock market has thoroughly trounced global stocks since 2015, and especially since the COVID pandemic that arrived in 2020. Massive amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus during the pandemic rapidly bounced the US economy out of recession and led to a robust recovery unmatched by any other large economy. US tech firms still dominate in artificial intelligence and other trends leading stocks higher. So the US market’s weak performance in 2025 could be a temporary blip. Yet longer-term fissures are also driving global investors out of the US market. America’s massive national debt, now more than $36 trillion , has started to cause wobbles in financial markets. Instead of dealing with the problem, Republicans who control Congress are poised to pass a package of tax cuts likely to add yet another $4 trillion to the debt. Read more: What is the US debt ceiling, and how does it impact you? At some point, there will be so much Treasury debt flooding the market that there won’t be enough buyers. That will force the Treasury to pay higher interest rates, making the whole problem worse. All other interest rates will rise in unison, raising borrowing costs throughout the US economy. No wonder all three major ratings agencies have now downgraded the US credit rating , with Moody’s being the last to do so in May. There have already been instances in recent months when US interest rates rose in circumstances where they’d normally be dropping . That alone triggered a “ sell America” trade in which investors ditched American assets in favor of foreign ones. The value of the US dollar, correspondingly, has weakened by 10% so far this year as demand for dollar-denominated assets weakens. One curiosity of the sell America trade is that countries Trump is targeting most aggressively with tariffs are still outperforming American stocks. Mexican stocks are beating the US market by 23 percentage points in 2025. European shares are beating their US counterparts by 15 points. Chinese stocks are doing 13 points better. Again, that reflects investor belief that the Trump tariffs will hit US profits more than foreign ones. To some extent, foreign stocks are catching up with an American market that has been investors' favorite for a decade. But Trump's tariffs could change the equation indefinitely.

McCormick CEO ahead of July 4: Consumers are digging into leftovers,2025-06-28 00:46:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mccormick-ceo-ahead-of-july-4-consumers-are-digging-into-leftovers-154643069.html,"It's the leftover economy headed into July 4 grilling season. ""There's more going on than just consumers focusing on leftovers. We see a big convergence right now. Consumers seeking value but also health and wellness. And it's really creating a lot of growth opportunity for McCormick,"" McCormick ( MKC ) CEO Brendan Foley said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid (watch above). Foley added that consumers are looking for value in flavor products and buying bigger sizes. They're also purchasing more meat and produce to make meals at home. ""They're making more trips to the grocery store, maybe putting a few items fewer in the basket. But largely they're still exploring with flavor, and they still need flavor,"" he said. With shoppers battling higher prices for everything from sneakers to snack foods in part due to tariffs, growth continues to be a tough slog for packaged food players such as McCormick. McCormick's second fiscal quarter sales rose 1% from the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share was unchanged year over year but beat analyst estimates by $0.04. Sales for the consumer segment rose 2.9%, powered by demand for hot sauce and mustard. The flavor solutions segment, which supplies products to restaurants, remained under pressure. Sales for the segment dropped 1.3% from a year ago. ""Broad weak CPG and QSR trends remain a watch-out in the Flavor Solutions business, but despite the softer environment, margin progression remains on track,"" Stifel analyst Matthew Smith wrote in a note. Smith maintained a Hold rating on McCormick shares. For the full fiscal year, McCormick forecasts sales to range from flat to up 2% year over year. Adjusted operating profits are expected to jump 3% to 5% as the company pushes through price increases. Podcast: Visa's chief economist on one of the biggest consumer shifts he is seeing This week, fellow food player General Mills ( GIS ) warned that more-cautious shoppers are pressuring sales of cereal and snack foods. The company missed profit estimates and had an underwhelming earnings call. Investors have generally soured on Big Food stocks amid the various headwinds on the business and relatively high valuation multiples, which are partly driven by their often-defensive business models in times of weak economic growth. McCormick shares are up 1.7% year to date relative to a 4.5% advance for the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ). Campbell's ( CPB ) shares are down 26%, and Kraft Heinz ( KHC ) is off by 16%. PepsiCo's ( PEP ) stock is hovering near a 52-week low after a 15% decline this year. Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor and a member of Yahoo Finance's editorial leadership team.

"Last-minute changes appear to be making Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' more expensive by the day",2025-06-28 05:20:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/last-minute-changes-appear-to-be-making-trumps-big-beautiful-bill-more-expensive-by-the-day-152441021.html,"Major pieces of President Trump's ""big, beautiful bill"" have been reshaped over the past week and many of the edits appear to have at least one thing in common: They are putting upward pressure on the bill's price tag. A complete accounting won't be available for days, but recent changes have signaled that the question may not be whether the projected $3 trillion-plus price tag will move upwards, but by how much. The changes are coming from a variety of directions and for different reasons, from Senate parliamentarian advisements on the rules to last-minute inducements for intransigent lawmakers to changes at the behest of the Trump administration. One major stumbling block appeared to be resolved Friday — but in a way that could add new costs. Republicans announced a tentative deal on state and local tax (SALT) deductions, with Senator John Hoeven telling reporters that the agreement will raise the limit to $40,000 a year for five years — from a level of $10,000 in the prior Senate version. Another major change came Thursday morning when the Senate's parliamentarian said that provisions around Medicaid provider taxes, which are projected to save hundreds of billions of dollars if enacted, couldn't be included in the bill. Also on Thursday, congressional Republicans removed another potential $100 billion-plus revenue source by striking a so-called revenge tax provision following a request from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The changes add more challenges to the goal of getting legislation to Trump's desk by July 4, especially as these changes are already getting noticed by fiscal conservatives even before everything is tallied up. Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Trump are applying maximum political pressure to finalize the bill with the president posting Friday that Senators would be ""working all weekend."" The first votes could also begin this weekend. On Friday morning, President Trump acknowledged that the back and forth was having an effect, saying ""the parliamentarian has been a little difficult"" and adding that he disagrees on some of the decisions but that it will be fine in the end. The president also said that meeting his current July 4 deadline for finishing the bill could slip, saying it's important to him to finish the bill by then ""but not the end-all."" Senate Majority Leader John Thune arrives for a speech on Capitol Hill on Thursday in Washington. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) · Andrew Harnik via Getty Images ""Several things are getting knocked out of the bill, which makes the budget math even harder and which makes the negotiations with the House even harder,"" Erica York of the Tax Foundation said in a recent interview. ""Certainly, there are a lot of challenges to overcome if this is gonna get done"" by the current July 4 deadline, she added. Thursday's developments came after another key cost savings — a ""pay for,"" in Washington parlance — was called into question earlier this week by another parliamentarian ruling that found Republicans won't be able to make certain cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) with the bill as written. An array of changes But perhaps the central question when it comes to the final price tag will be the final shape of proposed Medicaid cuts. This portion of the bill has long been the biggest cost saver, with the Congressional Budget Office previously estimating that the healthcare provisions in the House version would cut spending by over $1 trillion over 10 years . Those complex provisions are currently under debate, with the Senate offering more stringent ideas in some cases, but with the Senate parliamentarian advising this week that some of those changes around provider taxes don't pass muster with the Senate's reconciliation rules process. There's also talk of a new $15 billion stabilization fund for rural hospitals impacted by the Medicaid cuts to offer an inducement for GOP lawmakers balking at the cuts — a change that could eat into the cost savings. It's also the latest key ""pay for"" to be called into question after the Senate parliamentarian advised earlier this week that some of the cuts to the SNAP program around state matching funds needed to change. These provisions were previously estimated to save roughly $128 billion. Both the Medicaid and SNAP pieces of the bill appear to be in the process of being rewritten in an attempt to add them back into the final package. Meanwhile, the White House shifted course on another projected $100 billion-plus revenue raiser with the removal of the so-called revenge tax after many companies raised concerns that new taxes there could dampen investment in the US. Republicans are even going back and forth on a fourth key cost saver in the bill: the rollback of green energy credits. President Trump arrives to speak at an event to promote his domestic policy and tax bill at the White House on Thursday. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) · ASSOCIATED PRESS The Senate version offered a slower timeline for the phaseout of these credits, which would likely save less money, but House Majority Leader Steve Scalise told PunchBowl News on Thursday that the idea is ""going to need to get reversed"" and that ""liberalizing it is not the direction to go.""

Why the terrible year for Google stock may be overblown,2025-06-27 22:40:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-the-terrible-year-for-google-stock-may-be-overblown-134019255.html,"Alphabet's ( GOOG , GOOGL ) rough run in 2025 may be nearing the end. In a new Jefferies report, its analysts argue that fears around Google's competitiveness in the AI era are overblown and that the stock's current valuation offers an ""attractive entry point"" for long-term investors. The firm maintained its Buy rating on Alphabet shares, keeping its price target at $210, representing more than 20% upside. The stock has been down 9% year to date, underperforming the Nasdaq and lagging far behind high-flying ""Magnificent Seven"" peers like Nvidia ( NVDA ), which hit a record high earlier this week. Jefferies' analysts, led by Brent Thill, identified five key reasons why Alphabet is one of the best-positioned AI consumer stocks. To start off, Google Search has remained resilient against competition from chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Perplexity. Google has maintained a 90% stranglehold on the search market, and there are signs its AI features are gaining traction. For example, its AI Overviews are used by 1.5 billion monthly active users . Meanwhile, YouTube is still undervalued, despite driving around 30% more revenue than Netflix, which trades at a higher multiple. Thill identified YouTube as a ""catalyst"" in a video-first world. Alphabet's flagship large language model, Gemini, hasn't gotten as much attention as OpenAI's ChatGPT, but it now processes 480 trillion tokens monthly, a 50x annual increase, per Jefferies. Its integration across Google products helps generate more intelligent results. This performance edge and data scale are reasons to stay bullish on the company's AI future , Thill said. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) has long trailed Amazon ( AMZN ) Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft ( MSFT ) Azure, but there is room for growth. Thill said there's upside from Google's leadership in AI and machine learning infrastructure tools and continued federal contracts. Investors may be underestimating the cloud unit's long-term potential. Even as Google invests heavily in AI, its margins are quietly recovering. Operating margin hit a record 40% in Q1 2025. Thill expects that trend to continue, thanks in part to past cost-cutting efforts, such as layoffs and buyouts and AI-driven efficiencies. In 2024, Alphabet's EBITDA margin expanded by 300 basis points. With $84 billion in net cash, the company has the flexibility to keep buying back shares and funding innovation. Perhaps the biggest part of Jefferies' bull case is the stock's valuation. Alphabet trades at just 11x forward-12-month EV/EBITDA, below its 10-year average of 12.4x and well off its recent high near 15x. That's despite a solid balance sheet; improving margins; growth opportunities in AI, cloud, and video; and moonshots like Waymo. ""We see an attractive risk/reward in the longterm,"" Thill wrote. Alphabet's underperformance this year may have more to do with market rotation and AI hype fatigue than any real fundamental weakness. The company is set to report second quarter earnings in late July after the bell, which could be the company's next chance to reset the narrative.

New inflation reading won't end rate-cut debate between Fed doves and hawks,2025-06-27 22:33:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/new-inflation-reading-wont-end-rate-cut-debate-between-fed-doves-and-hawks-133321331.html,"An escalating debate within the Federal Reserve about the case for interest rate cuts is not going to be settled by a new inflation reading that offered ammunition for both hawks and doves. Hawkish officials who are worried about tariff-related price hikes will likely point to the fact that the latest reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge showed price increases accelerated in May as inflation remained above the Fed's 2% target. But in the same report, the Bureau of Economic Analysis also showed that US consumer spending declined in May by the most since the start of 2025, which may help the dovish argument that rate cuts are needed to offset any slowdown in growth that could also accompany President Trump's tariffs. The division within the Fed emerged last week in the Fed's latest ""dot plot"" outlining future interest rate moves. While 10 officials saw two cuts or more still happening in 2025, seven officials predicted no cuts at all, up from the four officials who made that call previously. Read more: What experts say about the possibility of additional rate cuts Fed governors Michelle Bowman and Chris Waller added to the divide by saying in recent days that they now see cutting rates as soon as the Fed's next policy meeting in July, due to recent mild inflation readings. But other officials this week have pushed back on that urgency and warned that it is too soon to know the true effects of tariffs on inflation. Some have said they could support a cut in September if inflation cooperates. Fed Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers this week that the central bank is ""well-positioned to wait"" on any interest rate adjustments until it has more clarity on how Trump's tariffs will affect inflation and the direction of the US economy. Powell and some of his colleagues have repeatedly pointed out that they expect to see a pickup in inflation this summer and that it is prudent to wait for that impact before acting. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks with Michelle Bowman at a Federal Reserve Board meeting on June 25. (Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images) · SAUL LOEB via Getty Images Powell's wait-and-see stance continues to inflame tensions with President Trump, who has called for sizable cuts due to what he called ""no inflation"" and the chance for the US to save on interest costs while carrying loads of debt. In fact, Trump made it clear this week that he is closer to selecting a successor to Powell, whose term as chair expires in May 2026, as he becomes more impatient about the Fed's policy stance. But the new inflation reading on Friday doesn't show that inflation is receding. The ""core"" Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out food and energy costs, rose 2.7% on an annual basis, above the 2.6% economists had expected and higher than the 2.6% seen in April . Core prices also rose 0.2% in May from the prior month, above the 0.1% economists had expected. But the same report from the Bureau of Economic Analysis also showed that Personal Consumption Expenditures fell 0.3%, which could affect the growth outlook.

Big Tech stocks still 'below their peak’ — why the rally will continue,2025-06-27 21:49:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-tech-stocks-still-below-their-peak--why-the-rally-will-continue-124901541.html,"Technology ( XLK ) is once again at the forefront of market momentum, leading sector gains over the past month as investors pile back into growth . Wall Street strategists say the AI-fueled rally still has legs, arguing that even at these elevated levels, Big Tech remains cheap. ""US equities in general, and tech stocks in particular, are still below their peak of earlier this year, so there is arguably room for the relief rally to continue,"" Capital Economics' John Higgins wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. Over the past week, the megacap-heavy Nasdaq 100 ( NQ=F ) returned to record highs, with chipmaker Nvidia ( NVDA ) now nearing a $4 trillion valuation after logging back-to-back all-time closing highs. That momentum has helped propel the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks back into a leadership position, fueled by stronger-than-expected earnings, easing macroeconomic fears , and continued investor enthusiasm over artificial intelligence. ""Some of these megacaps don't look that expensive to me relative to the growth potential,"" Jordan Klein, tech analyst at Mizuho, told Yahoo Finance, pointing to Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ), Amazon ( AMZN ), and Meta ( META ) as names that still offer value at current levels. Meanwhile, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who has called Nvidia the ""godfather of AI,"" estimated the chipmaker could eventually hit a $5 trillion to $6 trillion valuation as AI use cases expand into consumer-facing applications, robotics, and autonomous tech. ""The Street is still underestimating [Nvidia's longer-term] growth by 15% to 20%,"" Ives told Yahoo Finance earlier this week. ""That could be conservative."" 'Markets are acting great' Investor sentiment has flipped sharply since the market's April lows, with money flowing back into tech after a brief period of defensive positioning amid escalating fears of a US recession on the heels of President Trump's ""Liberation Day"" announcement. In a note to clients on Tuesday, Bank of America said tech inflows last week reached their highest level since June 2024. ""The mistake was people were quick to write off the Mag Seven,"" Klein said. ""Tech went from a big overweight exiting last year to being an underweight by April and May."" Now, with markets moving past peak uncertainty and investors gaining more clarity on trade policies, Klein argued that the case for tech is strengthening. ""These are massive companies, extremely well run,"" he said. ""Their balance sheets and their ability to maintain margin and cash flows is unparalleled."" Wall Street strategists are bullish on Big Tech stocks as tariff uncertainty fades. · mizoula via Getty Images Mark Newton, global head of technical strategy at Fundstrat, agreed the current setup favors Wall Street bulls: ""Markets are acting great,"" he said.

Until we see hedge funds and [CTAs, or algorithm-driven traders] really start to pour money back in, trends look great, the economy is good, and earnings are good."" Adding conviction to the upside, the rally is no longer confined to just tech alone. Over the past week, industrials, financials, transports, and consumer discretionary stocks have all staged meaningful rebounds , signaling broad market participation that, in Newton’s view, strengthens the case for further gains. ""Many people get skeptical as indices hit new all-time highs,"" he said. ""But honestly, that’s the time you really got to pay attention."" And while concerns about tariffs, interest rates, and geopolitical risks remain, the market’s ability to look through short-term noise is exactly what’s driving the rebound. ""Market tends to price in events like [geopolitical conflict or tariffs] very, very quickly,"" Newton said. ""If the market's truly caught off guard like it was in early April, then yes, you might have temporary periods of downside volatility. But it's important to put on those blinders and not let emotions dictate your investment strategy."" StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.

Fed's preferred inflation gauge shows price increases accelerated in May,2025-06-27 22:37:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/feds-preferred-inflation-gauge-shows-price-increases-accelerated-in-may-123850424.html,"The latest reading of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge showed price increases accelerated in May as inflation remained above the Fed's 2% target. The release comes as investors have been closely watching data releases for signs of when, or if, the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year. The ""core"" Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out food and energy costs and is closely watched by the central bank, rose 2.7% on an annual basis, above the 2.6% economists had expected and higher than the 2.6% seen in April . The April reading was revised higher to 2.6% from an originally reported 2.5% increase. Core prices rose 0.2% in May from the prior month, above the 0.1% economists had expected, which would have been in line with April's increase. On a yearly basis, overall PCE increased by 2.3%, above the 2.2% increase from the month prior. Read more: How to protect your savings against inflation Elsewhere in the release, data showed signs of slowing economic growth activity. Real personal spending, which adjusts for inflation, decreased 0.3% in May after increasing 0.1% in April. Meanwhile, personal income fell 0.4% in May, well below the 0.7% increase seen in April and the 0.3% increase economists had expected. ""The trend in parts of discretionary spending has weakened, and we expect a further slowdown in the coming months as tariffs begin to weigh on real disposable incomes,"" Oxford Economics deputy chief US economist Michael Pearce wrote in a note to clients. The data's release comes after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testified in front of House lawmakers, stressing that the central bank is ""well-positioned to wait"" before moving interest rates. But debate over when the central bank will cut interest rates has been heating up. After Friday's release, markets were pricing in a 22.7% chance the central bank cuts interest rates at its next meeting in late July, up from a 14.5% chance seen last week, per the CME FedWatch Tool . Odds of a cut by the end of September had also surged, with markets now pricing in a 92% chance the central bank will have lowered rates by then, up from a 70% chance seen just a week ago.

The open road ahead for investors,2025-06-27 19:00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-open-road-ahead-for-investors-100012913.html,"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings SPACS are back . Bitcoin's riding high . Nvidia's ( NVDA ) market cap is $3.8 trillion. Imminent or at least soonish rate cuts are back on the table . And the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) is flirting with a new closing record amid tech optimism . Stripped of context and isolated from worrisome headlines, you'd think the market was operating in a different time period . But here we are. The news environment and political moment matter, of course, as this latest bout of unleashed animal spirits is a reaction to shrinking negative catalysts and the dissolving of some of the most troublesome uncertainties. The current pivot back to 2024 market narratives has been a sharp one, and the week's Fed drama was bolstered by a pair of readings Thursday: A weaker first quarter GDP estimate than was previously reported and fresh labor data bolstered the case that it's getting tougher for people out of a job to find work. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Morning Brief Subscribe By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy The updates appeared to convince more investors that the Fed will speed up rate-cutting plans to address deteriorating economic conditions. Market bets are welcoming the ""bad news"" with open arms because it means there's a chance the first rate cut could arrive as soon as July, and if not, almost certainly by September, and because that ""bad news"" comes as the unemployment rate is still — as Powell is wont to remind the public — at a historically low 4.2%. The dovish turn coincides with a sentiment shift that the tariff impact will be more muted than originally thought . And market optimism has been jolted as Wall Street interprets the hostilities between the US and Iran as on a path to deescalation. ""The stock market is back at record highs as various uncertainties start to fade,"" said Paul Stanley, chief investment officer at Granite Bay Wealth Management, in a note Thursday. ""The market is betting on continued progress on trade and a de-escalation of tensions in the Middle East is giving investors confidence."" But as Stanley and others point out, even as the market reaches for new highs, it's unclear what the next major catalyst could be with last quarter's major obstacles out of the way. If so much of the positive momentum flowed from the collapse of worst-case scenarios, focus now goes to the positive ones. And there certainly are plenty to count. Fed cut speculation could turn into an actual Fed cut — or Fed cuts. The Magnificent Seven could get their mojo back and turn around a rough year. More trade deals could emerge instead of trade war pauses. That's one way to look at it. But things can obviously keep trucking along even when the drama dies down. Conditions have been so volatile that it's easy to forget earnings growth and the AI story were more than enough to power the market for a good while. When volatility drops, the market's rise almost seems gravitational. With a clearer playing field, what's to stop that from happening again?

"Meta, Anthropic win legal battles over AI 'training.' The copyright war is far from over.",2025-06-29 22:56:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-anthropic-win-legal-battles-over-ai-training-the-copyright-war-is-far-from-over-090046469.html,"Artificial intelligence developers won marginal legal battles this week when federal judges in California ruled that Anthropic ( ANTH.PVT ) and Meta ( META ) could ""train"" large language models (LLM) on copyrighted books. But the larger war over AI developers' use of protected works is far from over. Dozens of copyright holders have sued developers, arguing that the developers must pay rights holders before allowing generative AI software to interpret their works for profit. Rights holders also argue that the AI output cannot resemble their original works. Rob Rosenberg, an intellectual property lawyer with Telluride Legal Strategies , called Tuesday's ruling siding with AI developer Anthropic a ""ground-breaking"" precedent, but one that should be viewed as an opening salvo. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei at the Code with Claude developer conference on May 22 in San Francisco. (Don Feria/AP Content Services for Anthropic) · ASSOCIATED PRESS ""Judges are just starting to apply copyright law to AI systems,"" Rosenberg said, with many cases coming down the pike. In that ruling, California US District Judge William Alsup said that Anthropic legally utilized millions of copyrighted books to train its various LLMs, including its popular chatbot Claude. However, the judge distinguished books that Anthropic paid for from a pirated library of more than 7 million books that it also used to train Claude. As for the stolen materials, the judge said, Anthropic must face the plaintiff authors' claims that it infringed on their copyrights. In a more limited ruling favoring Meta on Wednesday, California US District Judge Vince Chhabria said that a group of 12 authors who sued the tech giant, including stand-up comedian Sarah Silverman, made ""wrong arguments"" that prevented him from ruling on infringement. According to the authors, Meta used their copyrighted books to train its large language model Llama . The rulings are among the first in the country to address emerging and unsettled questions over how far LLMs can go to rely on protected works. Comedian Sarah Silverman at a Los Angeles red carpet event in 2023. (Reuters/Mike Blake) · REUTERS / Reuters ""There is no predicting what's going to come out the other end of those cases,"" said Courtney Lytle Sarnow , an intellectual property partner with CM Law and adjunct professor at Emory University School of Law. Sarnow and other intellectual property experts said they expect the disputes will end up in appeals to the US Supreme Court. ""I think it's premature for Anthropic and others like it to be taking victory laps,"" said Randolph May, president of the Free State Foundation and former chair of the American Bar Association's Administrative Law and Regulatory Practice section. What is 'fair use'? US copyright law, as defined by the Copyright Act, gives creators of original works an exclusive right to reproductions, distributions, and public performances of their material, according to Sarnow, including some derivative works and sequels to their original creations. Absent a license from the rights holders to use their copyrighted material, all large language models are stealing from authors, she said. But under US law, a certain level of what would otherwise be deemed stealing is, in fact, an exception permitted under the doctrine of ""fair use."" That doctrine makes it legal to use the material without a license for commentary and critique, to reference it for news reporting and education, and to transform it into something new and distinct that serves a purpose different from the original form. Both Anthropic and Meta argued that training their LLMs on copyrighted material didn't violate the Copyright Act because the models transformed the original authors' content into something new. In his ruling, Judge Alsup reasoned that Anthropic's use of books was ""exceedingly transformative"" and therefore qualified as fair use under the Copyright Act. Rosenberg and Sarnow said it's too soon to tell how courts will ultimately rule on the issue. In cases where a ""transformative"" use is being used as a defense, LLM defendants need to show that their use of copyrighted material did not disrupt the market for the authors' original works. Judge Chhabria criticized Alsup's ruling, calling his analysis incomplete for ""brushing aside"" such market concerns. Meta chief product officer Chris Cox speaks at LlamaCon 2025, an AI developer conference, on April 29. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) · ASSOCIATED PRESS ""Under the fair use doctrine, harm to the market for the copyrighted work is more important than the purpose for which the copies are made,"" Judge Chhabria said. No 'free pass' Anthropic still faces some other big legal challenges. Reddit sued the company earlier in June. The suit alleges Anthropic intentionally scraped Reddit users' personal data without their consent and then put their data to work training Claude. Anthropic is also defending itself against a suit from music publishers, including Universal Music Group ( 0VD.F ), ABKCO, and Concord, alleging that Anthropic infringed on copyrights for Beyoncé, the Rolling Stones, and other artists as it trained Claude on lyrics to more than 500 songs. The company faces more peril in the case where a judge determined it must face claims from authors that it infringed on their copyrights by paying for a pirated library of more than 7 million books. For copyright infringement, willful violations can result in statutory fines up to $150,000 per violation. If Anthropic were found liable for intentionally misusing the 7 million books at issue in its case, the maximum allowable penalties, though not usually imposed, could end up north of $1 trillion. Three authors brought the case, requesting that the court grant their request to pursue their claims as a class action. The judge's decision on the class certification request is pending.

A look at who could replace Powell as Fed chair,2025-06-29 00:25:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/a-look-at-who-could-replace-powell-as-fed-chair-080004505.html,"There is now a short list of people who could succeed Jerome Powell as the next Federal Reserve chair, each with their own pros and cons. They include former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, former World Bank president David Malpass, and current Fed governor Christopher Waller. Jerome Powell's term as chair of the Fed is up in May 2026. (Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images) · SAUL LOEB via Getty Images President Trump is expected to make his decision soon, two people close to the administration told Yahoo Finance, as he grows more impatient with Powell's wait-and-see stance on interest rates. Powell's term as chair is not up until May 2026. Trump wants to announce a pick early as a shot across the bow at Powell, according to longtime Trump adviser Stephen Moore. ""I'd love him to resign if he wanted to,"" Trump added Friday, when prodded by reporter about whether he wanted the chairman to resign. ""He's done a lousy job."" Here’s a closer look at the potential contenders: Kevin Warsh There was a period earlier in 2025 when Warsh was viewed as the favorite to take over Powell's job. He already has a lot of experience navigating inside the central bank. He served as Fed governor from 2006 until 2011 and became former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke’s liaison to Wall Street during the chaos of the 2008 financial crisis. He is also a known figure to Trump, who interviewed him for the Fed chair post eight years ago before deciding on Powell. Trump spoke to Warsh in February and March about replacing Powell, according to the Wall Street Journal , but Warsh advised the president against any such action until Powell’s term is up in May 2026. He has been critical of the Fed as of late. He gave an April 25 speech in Washington, D.C., in which he said that its ""current wounds are largely self-inflicted"" and called for a ""strategic reset"" to ease a loss of credibility and damage to the Fed's standing. Former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, in 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid · REUTERS / Reuters In an earlier op-ed in the Wall Street Journal this January , Warsh predicted the Fed would try to blame high inflation on Trump and said he believed that any inflationary effect of tariff policies would likely be of smaller magnitude than the disinflationary influence of deregulation and spending cuts. ""In my time as a governor at the Fed, we would look through one-off price changes,"" he said, a view of how the central bank should act on tariffs that has been echoed by the White House. But past statements from Warsh also suggest he could be hawkish on the issue of inflation, which could become a concern for the White House as it pushes for lower rates. One person close to the administration said that the president is souring on Warsh. Read more: How the Fed rate decision affects your bank accounts, loans, credit cards, and investments Chris Waller The pro argument for Waller is that he is already on the Fed board as a governor, and he was the first central bank policymaker to call for lower rates in July following the Fed's last meeting on June 18-19. Waller has said he believes any tariff-induced inflation will not be persistent and that inflation expectations are anchored. As a result, he supports looking through any tariff effects on near-term inflation when setting rates. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution in 2024. REUTERS/Ann Saphir/File Photo · Reuters / Reuters This aligns with the White House's view that any price increases will be transitory. Trump also appointed him to the Fed board five years ago. But Moore, a longtime adviser to the president, told Yahoo Finance that Waller's candidacy is harmed by the fact that he voted to keep rates on hold at the last central bank meeting. Scott Bessent Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told House lawmakers earlier this month he would like to remain in his seat as Treasury secretary but has not dismissed the possibility of becoming the next chair of the Federal Reserve. Bessent said he has ""the best job"" in Washington and is ""happy to do what President Trump wants me to do,"" while noting that he ""would like to stay in my seat through 2029"" to help carry out the administration’s agenda. Before Trump was elected, Bessent in 2024 also floated the idea of naming a ""shadow chair"" well before Powell's term was up, ensuring that ""no one is really going to care what Jerome Powell has to say anymore."" Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) · Tom Williams via Getty Images Since being named Treasury secretary, Bessent has largely stayed out of voicing opinions on monetary policy, saying that the administration is looking to bring down longer-term bond yields through pro-growth policies of tax cuts, deregulation, and trade negotiations. He has refuted the notion that tariffs will lead to any persistent inflation, but has acknowledged there could be a one-time increase in prices. Bessent has a longstanding reputation as a respected Wall Street figure after decades in the investment management business. He last served as CEO and chief investment officer of Key Square Capital Management, a global hedge fund focused on macro investing that he founded in 2015. Before that, Bessent was the chief investment officer of Soros Fund Management. David Malpass What will help the candidacy of David Malpass is that he has been calling for the Fed to lower rates for months now as a way of boosting growth. “The Fed is really important to growth, and Trump is right that we've got to have lower interest rates and lower bond yields to get there,” Malpass told Fox Business Network back in March, noting that the Fed’s forecast for the economy was low. He made another argument for lower rates just this month, in a June 13 opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal. ""Many signs indicate that rates should be lower, but the Fed has chosen to keep the interest rate steady because of its limits-to-growth economic models,"" he wrote. Read more: What experts say about the possibility of additional rate cuts David Malpass in 2023, when he was president of the World Bank. REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz · REUTERS / Reuters ""A clear path is available to the Fed to lower interest rates as Mr. Trump’s policies add critical manufacturing and energy capacity and give priority to a stable dollar as the world’s reserve currency."" Trump named Malpass as the president of the World Bank during his first term and he served in that role from 2019 to 2023. He was also US Treasury Undersecretary for International Affairs in 2017-2019 under Trump’s first administration. Malpass also spent 24 years on Wall Street as an economist and held senior economic roles under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. Kevin Hassett National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett already has a close relationship with Trump, given that he advises the president on economic policy and also served in the first Trump administration. Earlier in the year he said he was more focused on 10-year Treasury yields ( ^TNX ) than on any quick monetary policy changes at the Federal Reserve. But more recently, he has gotten more explicit about the need for the Fed to act. He told CNBC on Monday that ""there is no reason at all for the Fed not to cut rates right now."" With one more month of mild inflation readings, he added, ""they will have to concede they have the rate way too high."" National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett in March. REUTERS/Kent Nishimura · REUTERS / Reuters Hassett noted that inflation is the lowest in four years by any measure right now and that he thinks growth is in a sweet spot. In April he did tell reporters that Trump and his team were continuing to study if they could fire Powell, a move that Powell has said is not legal. Trump has since backed off threats to fire Powell, although he mused about doing so again last week. But the Wall Street Journal reported this week that Hassett has told people he isn’t interested in Powell's job.

Coinbase gained 5% to notch its first all-time high since November 2021. The stock has surged more than 40% since the Senate passed the GENIUS Act last week. The landmark legislation is aimed at establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins, digital tokens backed by assets such as the US dollar and short-term treasuries. Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani this week dubbed Coinbase the ""Amazon of crypto financial services."" His team raised their price target on the stock to a Street high of $510 from $310, with an Outperform rating. On Thursday, shares traded near $375 each, more than 950% above their ""crypto winter"" lows in late 2022 following the collapse of FTX. Today, analysts point to Coinbase's buildout of a suite of crypto financial services beyond trading, including the stablecoin industry. Earlier this month, shopping platform Shopify ( SHOP ) partnered with Coinbase and payment processing company Stripe ( STRI.PVT ) to launch digital wallet stablecoin payments, allowing merchants to accept the tokens globally. Read more about Coinbase and Circle's stock moves and today's market action. Meanwhile, shares of Circle, of which Coinbase owns a minority stake, have also soared. The stock is now up more than 575% from its IPO price of $31 per share as investors bet on the rapid global adoption of the company's flagship product, USDC stablecoins. On Monday morning, Bernstein initiated coverage of the stock with an Outperform rating and a $230 price target. ""Over the long term, we expect stablecoins to evolve from money-rail of crypto markets to money-rail of the internet,"" wrote Bernstein's Chhugani. ""We believe, total industry stablecoin supply will reach ~$4Tn over the next decade vs. ~$225Bn today."" Momentum around Circle has also been fueled by a wave of new stablecoin initiatives from major financial players. Read more: Can you buy crypto with a credit card? See the pros and cons. On Monday, fintech firm Fiserv ( FI ) announced plans to launch a digital asset platform, including a new stablecoin (FIUSD) by the end of this year using existing infrastructure from issuers Paxos and Circle. One analyst, however, warned of possible share price pressures later this year as competition in the stablecoin space intensifies. ""We expect competition to accelerate after stablecoin legislation passes,"" Compass Point analyst Ed Engel wrote in a note Tuesday. ""This influx of competition could reduce long-term market share expectations and pressure CRCL shares in 2025."" Engel and his team initiated coverage of the stock with a Neutral rating and $205 price target. On Thursday, shares of Circle were trading near $210 a piece.

The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) came just shy from its February record of 6,144.15 to gain 0.8%, closing the session at 6,141.02. The Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) moved up more than 1%, finishing within a handful of points from its own record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) also roughly 400 points or 0.9%. Nvidia stock ( NVDA ) was up 1%, building on its record high on Wednesday . President Trump appeared to get closer to naming his replacement for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Trump's frustration with Powell's ""wait and see"" approach to interest rates has led him to consider announcing his pick to succeed the Fed chair in September or October, The Wall Street Journal reported . Markets view that as a signal that early US rate cuts have become more likely, given Trump has criticized the Fed chair for not lowering borrowing costs. Rate cut bets have also intensified as the labor market shows continued signs of weakness. Meanwhile, stocks also gained on Thursday as the White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt remarked that Trump's July 9 deadline ""is not critical"" for countries to strike trade deals with the US to avoid reciprocal tariffs. Earlier, the White House's chief economist, Stephen Miran, told Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi that Trump would likely extend the deadline for countries ""negotiating in good faith."" The dollar ( DX=F ) retreated to its lowest level since April 2022, already under pressure from concerns about tariff impacts and a looming US default. Treasury yields also declined, with the benchmark 10-year ( ^TNX ) trading around 4.25%. Investors got a snapshot of the health of the economy in a clutch of data Thursday. The highlights: The US economy shrank 0.5% in the first quarter, according to the government's final estimate , worse than previously thought. Jobless claims rose, with continuing claims rising to their highest level since late 2021. The main event for Wall Street to end the week lands Friday with the release of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report.

The broad-based index added about 0.8%, coming just shy of its February record close. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) added 0.9% or 400 points. The Nasdaq Composite also gained nearly 1%, buoyed by shares of AI chip giant Nvidia ( NVDA ), which closed at another record high on Thursday. Thu, June 26, 2025 at 7:10 PM UTC Josh Schafer Investor bets on July rate cut increase as 'employment risks are trending higher' Investors are growing increasingly confident that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by the end of the year, as labor market data has shown signs of cooling in recent weeks . Data from the Department of Labor released Thursday showed 1.974 million continuing claims were filed in the week ending June 14, up from 1.937 million the week prior and the highest level seen since November 2021. Economists see an increase in continuing claims as a sign that those out of work are taking longer to find new jobs. ""Employment risks are trending higher,"" Jefferies US economist Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. Elsewhere in economic data on Thursday, the third estimate for gross domestic product for the first quarter showed that US economic growth contracted at an annualized rate of 0.5%, more than the 0.2% previously reported. Following Thursday's data releases, markets were pricing in a 27% chance the central bank cuts interest rates at its next meeting in late July, up from a 12.5% chance seen last week, per the CME FedWatch Tool . Odds of a cut by the end of September have also surged, with markets now pricing in a 92% chance the central bank will have lowered rates by then, up from a 64% chance seen just a week ago.

CoreWeave has tried to acquire the bitcoin miner and data center operator before — as recently as last year. But Core Scientific said last June that it rejected the ""unsolicited"" proposal to purchase it for $5.75 per share (valuing the company at over $1 billion). Core Scientific had a market cap of more than $4.5 billion as of Thursday. Core Scientific, which went bankrupt in 2022 but emerged after restructuring in 2024, already does business with CoreWeave. Last year, the two firms announced a "" series of 12-year contracts "" for Core Scientific to host CoreWeave's Nvidia GPUs at its data centers. CoreWeave is one of the largest holders of Nvidia's ( NVDA ) graphics processing units and rents its data center capacity to Big Tech firms such as Microsoft ( MSFT ) and Meta ( META ), as their own stores of GPUs haven't been sufficient to power their AI ambitions. CoreWeave's business model has drawn skepticism from some on Wall Street due to its massive pile of debt borrowed at high interest rates.

""My expectation would be that for countries that are negotiating in good faith and making progress, that rolling back the deadline makes sense,"" Council of Economic Advisers chairman Stephen Miran said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid . ""I mean, you don't blow up a deal that's that's in process and making really good faith, sincere, authentic progress by dropping a tariff bomb in it.""

"New car price inflation may already be here, and tariffs will make it worse: Cox Automotive",2025-06-27 04:14:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/new-car-price-inflation-may-already-be-here-and-tariffs-will-make-it-worse-cox-automotive-191406711.html,"Analysts at Cox Automotive believe tariff-induced price hikes are coming for new cars — and could already be here. ""The new vehicle market is likely to see the return of inflation, and it may already be happening,"" Cox senior economist Charlie Chesbrough said during the company's 2025 midyear review and second-half outlook. ""Given the impact of tariffs, prices are likely to start rising at a much faster rate, so the trend suggests higher vehicle prices are coming to the new vehicle market,"" Chesbrough added. Chesbrough said the combination of higher-priced models affected by tariffs coming to replace depleted inventories, the declining use of incentives, and potential supply disruptions will create conditions that will shoot prices higher in the new car market.

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) · Justin Sullivan via Getty Images President Trump's auto sector tariffs began on April 3, but automakers had built up big buffers of non-tariffed supply before then. Supply is a big factor in pricing, and that non-tariff supply is dwindling. Cox data shows that in March, the industry's supply stood at 92 days. In June, that figure fell to 70, with some automakers like Toyota ( TM ) and Honda ( HMC ) having around half that amount. ""The supply this year has been falling dramatically since March as the tariff-induced buying surge drew down available inventories,"" Chesbrough said.

As prices are poised to rise, sales may soon drop accordingly. May's sales pace fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 15.6 million, Chesbrough said, with June slumping even further to 15.3 million, with more declines to follow. ""The impact of tariffs have not been felt, and that will change in the 2nd half of this year,"" Chesbrough said. Chesbrough said the Cox team predicts that if tariffs remain in place, sales will fall around 1% to 2% to 15.7 million for the year, down from 15.9 million last year. The pain from falling sales won't hit all automakers uniformly. While GM ( GM ) performed well in the first half of the year, Cox predicts Toyota ( TM ) and Ford ( FORD ) could outperform in the second half, based on strong results in the second quarter.

Trump's tariff revenue is on pace for another monthly record in June,2025-06-28 23:42:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-tariff-revenue-is-on-pace-for-another-monthly-record-in-june-170536916.html,"President Trump's tariffs are pouring billions more into US coffers in June, putting the revenue supplied by importers on pace for another monthly record. The latest measure of government receipts for ""Customs and Certain Excise Taxes"" stood at almost $27 billion for the month of June, according to the Treasury Department’s latest daily statement dated June 25. Read more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet The monthly total is likely to rise only slightly in the coming days, with importers often depositing their tariff duties in a single day and the June 24 statement showing a massive daily deposit of more than $19.9 billion. June’s total so far has already topped May’s total haul of about $22 billion — not to mention April and March totals of $17.4 billion and $9.6 billion, respectively. It was a continuation of revenue spikes seen during Trump's second term in office that are dwarfing counts from recent history as well as the amounts collected during Trump's first term. All told, more than $121 billion has flowed into government coffers since the start of this fiscal year. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick touted the pace of deposits earlier this week in a social media post that criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell . “What he avoids discussing is the incredible revenue increase the US has received from these tariffs,"" Lutnick said in his post, suggesting the US’s “current run rate” is for more than $30 billion per month. June’s revenue totals mark the first month where tariff rates have largely remained unchanged after months of up-and-down duties early in Trump's second term. In April, as an example, Trump’s 10% duties on nearly every country in the world began on the 5th of that month. The new data also comes after the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected earlier this month that Trump's tariffs could reduce primary deficits by $2.8 trillion over the coming decade — but with a significant assumption that current duties stay constant and in place even after Trump is scheduled to leave office. Read more: 5 ways to tariff-proof your finances In a Yahoo Finance Live interview on Thursday, Council of Economic Advisers Chair Stephen Miran suggested that results could be even higher than the CBO, saying, “Our internal estimates are maybe a hair higher than that.” The president is also threatening new tariffs in the weeks and months ahead — including what is being billed as “Liberation Day 2.0” on July 9 — even as Miran on Thursday echoed White House signals in recent weeks that the deadline there could be extended for at least some countries seen as negotiating in good faith. President Donald Trump flashes a thumbs up as he exits Marine One on June 6. (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images) · ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS via Getty Images The data released this week has yet to be finalized and could be slightly overstated, with the Treasury Department reporting both customs duties and certain excise taxes as a single category from the Department of Homeland Security. Excise taxes are different from customs duties. More precise data for only customs duties is expected in a few weeks, but customs duties have historically made up nearly the entirety of that combined figure. The June uptick in revenues, in any case, is on a pace of roughly $1 billion a day in revenue and that remains a tiny fraction of all monthly government spending. In May — the most recent full month of data available — total government receipts totaled $371 billion. In recent decades, tariff revenue has tended to constitute about 2% of federal revenue. The surge in recent months has changed that, with revenues now accounting for closer to 4%-5% of that revenue. Ben Werschkul is a Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.

(BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images) · BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI via Getty Images Read more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet Another area of focus has been the Trump tax plan, known formally as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act . The legislation was passed by the Republican-controlled House in March. Since then, the Senate has been working to find common ground to pass the bill and hand it to Trump before a self-imposed July 4 deadline. Some of the biggest components of the plan include extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts to the tune of $3.75 trillion and cutting about $1.3 trillion from various government programs such as Medicaid and food assistance. Estimates of the impact of the plan have varied. New research from the CEA estimated the Senate tax plan would create more than $100 billion in investment and 1 million-plus new jobs over a 10-year span. The economic growth fueled by the tax plan — including trillions in revenue from tariffs — is estimated to reduce the deficit by $2.1 trillion to $2.3 trillion. However, tariffs are independent from the tax plan and will be negotiated separately with trading partners. ""The 'one, big beautiful bill' contains numerous tax incentives for better economic growth,"" Miran claimed. ""There's full expensing on investment, full expensing on equipment, investment on new factories on R&D. There's things like no taxes on tips and overtime and Social Security. And these are targeted at segments of the population that are very responsive to incentives to work more. And these will get economic growth booming."" Podcast: This former top Biden economist makes a key economic prediction The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), however, estimated the bill could lift deficits by $2.8 trillion over the next 10 years, partially due to more subdued economic growth estimates relative to the CEA's research.

Data from the Department of Labor released Thursday showed 1.974 million continuing claims were filed in the week ending June 14, up from 1.937 million the week prior and the highest level seen since November 2021. Economists see an increase in continuing claims as a sign that those out of work are taking longer to find new jobs. ""Employment risks are trending higher,"" Jefferies US economist Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. Elsewhere in economic data on Thursday, the third estimate for gross domestic product (GDP) for the first quarter showed that US economic growth contracted at an annualized rate of 0.5%, more than the 0.2% previously reported. Following Thursday's data releases, markets were pricing in a 27% chance the central bank cuts interest rates at its next meeting in late July, up from a 12.5% chance seen last week, per the CME FedWatch Tool . Odds of a cut by the end of September have also surged, with markets now pricing in a 92% chance the central bank will have lowered rates by then, up from a 64% chance seen just a week ago. In a speech on June 23 , Federal Reserve governor Michelle Bowman noted that although the labor market is showing signs of strength, it ""appears to be less dynamic.""

Amazon's 3 secret advantages that could power its stock higher,2025-06-26 22:45:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazons-3-secret-advantages-that-could-power-its-stock-higher-134552340.html,"Amazon ( AMZN ) has been one of tech's standout stocks this year — and one analyst thinks there may still be plenty of fuel left in the tank. In a new note, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth called Amazon stock his ""best idea"" and cited three under-the-radar advantages that could drive efficiency and margin expansion: regionalized logistics, robotics innovation, and a growing push into logistics as a service (LaaS). The firm reiterated its Overweight rating and set a December 2025 price target of $240 per share, implying a more than 20% upside from current levels. Amazon shares have surged in June, rising about 14% month to date and outpacing the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ). The rally comes as investors show optimism about the company's advertising and Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing units. During Amazon's first quarter, AWS revenue grew 17% while ad revenue rose 19%. According to Yahoo Finance data, Amazon stock currently holds a Strong Buy consensus from more than two dozen analysts. JPMorgan notes that Amazon has been quietly restructuring its massive fulfillment network, shifting from a national model to a regional one. That means customer orders are now more likely to be sourced and delivered from nearby warehouses, reducing shipping distance and costs. This regionalization strategy helped Amazon deliver more than 9 billion same-day or next-day packages in 2024, per the note. The company's unit growth rose 8% year over year in Q1, outpacing its shipping costs, which increased 3%. Amazon is planning to double its network of same-day fulfillment facilities — the least expensive buildings in its real estate footprint — which could cut delivery costs further. JPMorgan notes that there are currently about 600 small-package US delivery stations, but they could reach as many as 1,000. AI and automation advancements could be another long-term cost saver. Potential technologies include generative AI for delivery mapping, enhanced demand forecasting, and advanced robots that could understand human language. JPMorgan notes that Amazon's next-gen warehouses combine fulfillment, sortation, and last-mile delivery in one location, cutting processing time by up to 25% and lowering peak-season costs. Over time, Amazon is expected to retrofit its existing warehouses with these capabilities. Beyond its own e-commerce business, Amazon is increasingly opening up its logistics infrastructure to third-party merchants. This logistics-as-a-service model could be a major revenue driver, similar to how AWS became a dominant platform by selling excess server capacity. The company already rivals the size of UPS in last-mile delivery. But risks remain, particularly as tariff uncertainty still hangs in the air. Rivals like Walmart are pursuing many of the same growth opportunities, and strategies like regionalization and robotics require massive upfront investment and time to show results. Earlier this week, Amazon said it would be expanding its same-day and next-day delivery service to more than 4,000 rural locations across the country , an effort buoyed by a $4 billion investment to triple its delivery network in 2026. Meanwhile, Walmart's same-day delivery now covers 93% of the US population, up from 76% two years ago, and is expected to reach 95% by the end of 2025. For now, JPMorgan said Amazon is still early in its transformation and that its scale, speed, and tech investments set it apart from peers. Amazon reports second quarter earnings in August, giving investors their next look at how the company's costs and growth stories are expanding.

Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya wrote in his own note to investors Wednesday that he forecasts demand for AI chips reaching a more modest but still impressive $650 billion by 2030, up from $201 billion in 2025. Arya said Nvidia is set to be a ""key beneficiary"" as it's ""still far ahead"" of new entrants in the sector. In another bullish sign for Nvidia, Micron ( MU ), which supplies memory chips for Nvidia's GPUs in data centers, beat Wall Street's expectations for its third quarter earnings results Wednesday, with executives citing strength in its AI business amid robust AI data center growth during a call with analysts. To be sure, there has been investor skepticism over whether Big Tech can continue its torrid pace of investment in AI, as companies are still working out how to monetize the technology. That skepticism was amplified when a new cost-effective AI model from Chinese firm DeepSeek caught the world’s attention in January. News of DeepSeek’s latest AI model in January sent Nvidia shares plummeting at the end of that month. Before its high Wednesday, Nvidia last hit a record close of $149.43 on Jan. 6. Nvidia stock had struggled in the months following its record close in January with the emergence of DeepSeek and as President Trump embarked on his trade war , which included the enactment of a ban on sales of the company's chips to China. Shares have seen a big upswing since the company announced trade deals in the Middle East and reported its first quarter earnings in late May, which showed revenue beating Wall Street's expectations and the company continuing to thrive despite Trump's export ban on its chips for China.

Brad Pitt's F1 racing movie debuts. Can it help bring the sport to new heights?,2025-06-29 05:21:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brad-pitts-f1-racing-movie-debuts-can-it-help-bring-the-sport-to-new-heights-120936853.html,"It’s a huge week for Formula One, but the action isn’t on the racetrack. “F1 The Movie” premiered in the US this Friday, June 27. The blockbuster with a rumored $200 million production budget backed by Apple ( AAPL ) and distributed by Warner Bros. ( WBD ) aims for glory in the highly competitive summer release calendar. As of Saturday, the movie was on track for a $140 million global opening weekend . The film is based on a tried-but-true formula (forgive the pun). Fictional aging racer Sonny Hayes (Brad Pitt) is brought on to an upstart team to help guide its rookie driver, but along the way he comes face to face with his own personal demons, and of course redemption. But that's the boring part. What has everyone, or at least car buffs, salivating is the access the filmmakers had to the sport: filming at real races using real F1 cars and technology, embedding themselves in the sport, and capturing footage that brings the viewer right into the driver's seat. A movie like this, especially with a big focus on the US audience, would have been a surprise only a few years ago.

(Photo by Jayce Illman/Getty Images) · Jayce Illman via Getty Images Part of this is because F1 — considered the most technically advanced, and glamorous, racing league — is finally growing in the US. In 2024, the sport reached about 30 million viewers across ESPN ( DIS ) platforms, with an average of 1.1 million viewers per race during the season. That's pretty good for a sport that used to count viewers in the thousands less than ten years ago. US fans, who discovered the sport and grew with it as shows like Netflix’s ( NFLX ) “Drive to Survive” brought drivers into viewers' living rooms, have become a coveted group to market. That's both for the sport, which is owned by Liberty Media ( FWONK ), and the many brands that have now signed on as sponsors. “[The F1] fanbase across the world is over 800 million; fanbase in the US is 50 million. But the really important thing is doubling year on year,” said James Vowles, the head of Williams F1 and a former longtime Mercedes team exec. “So great trajectory commercially, and if we look at all of the partners and sponsors that we have, a third of them are from the US, which just tells you how important it is.” The APX GP car of Sonny Hayes, portrayed by Brad Pitt in the upcoming 'F1' movie by Jpseph Kosinski is driving on the track during Formula 1 Testing at Yas Marina Circuit on December 10, 2024 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. (Photo by Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images) · NurPhoto via Getty Images Moviegoers, from the hardcore F1 fans to those who just want to see Brad Pitt drive a race car, will be most impressed by how close the filmmakers were to the sport in capturing the action. “It's not a documentary, but it is authentic to us as a sport,” Vowles said. “[Producer] Jerry [Bruckheimer], [director] Joe [Kosinski], and the team were really, really impressive at integrating themselves across [the last two seasons], such that as far as I went, we had an 11th team alongside us. It was really seamless in terms of integration.” The F1 movie team had its own F1 race cars, fictional team personnel, and even pit setups to replicate the 11th team on the real F1 grid. Apple created special cameras that were embedded in the race cars to capture all the action. The realism is an important aspect of the movie, and portraying it effectively is good for the brand, Vowles said. Still from ""F1 The Movie"" (credit: Apple) · Apple “I think what we've done really well, and it's a combination of Liberty, combination of Netflix and I think the Formula 1 film as well, is actually portraying how much of a team sport it is, how much we got 1000 people behind the scenes working every hour they can to develop the car, every single race to be different,” Vowles said. Plenty of large US multinational companies have bought into the F1 story via team sponsorships —including Oracle ( ORCL ), Visa ( V ), Walmart ( WMT ), HP ( HPQ ), and Alphabet’s Google ( GOOG ) among them. Williams counts US brands like Duracell batteries ( BRK-B ), Michelob Ultra beer ( BUD ), and crypto exchange Kraken ( KRAK.PVT ), among others, as sponsors, and US-based investment firm Dorilton Capital is Williams’s majority owner. Now Williams itself would like to see more brands — US or otherwise — join its sponsorship ranks. Title sponsorships, like Williams’ Atlassian deal, can for the most successful teams result in $20 million or more in revenue. Williams had a strong 2024, but has had mixed results this year, sitting fifth in the team standings. Poor results mean less shared revenue, which in 2024 was split among the teams from a pool of $1.23 billion , with the higher-performing teams getting more money. Poor results also mean less money from sponsors. Brad Pitt, actor, attends the Mexico City Grand Prix Qualifying event at the Autodromo Hnos. Rodriguez in Mexico City, Mexico, on October 26, 2024. (Photo by Gerardo Vieyra/NurPhoto via Getty Images) · NurPhoto via Getty Images There’s also the concern that the sport of F1 has been stretched too far in the US, with newer fans harder to come by. ESPN has reportedly opted out of its TV rights deal with F1 , with Liberty Media seeking a new deal worth upwards of $150 million per season , nearly double the current TV deal. Streamers like Netflix, Amazon, and Apple may step in, betting on future growth. As for Vowles, who just inked a new deal to run the team, he believes Williams is a “sleeping giant"" in F1 despite this year's struggles, citing the team's winning history of nine world championships and seven drivers championships, new investments, and strong drivers like Carlos Sainz and Alex Albon. Whether Williams, now competing in its 48th season, can get back to its winning ways is an open question. The hope is that Brad Pitt's aging racer seeking redemption in ""F1 The Movie"" can lend a hand.

Should you use AI for your retirement plan? Expert weighs in.,2025-06-26 20:00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/should-you-use-ai-for-your-retirement-plan-expert-weighs-in-110049199.html,"Listen and subscribe to Decoding Retirement on Apple Podcasts , Spotify , or wherever you find your favorite podcasts. Can artificial intelligence help you build a retirement plan and figure out how much to save or invest? The short answer is no, not yet, said Nick Holeman, director of financial planning at digital advisory company Betterment. ""I would be cautious about using it for personalized financial advice right now,"" Holeman said in a recent episode of Decoding Retirement. ""We're seeing a lot of traction with general financial education. In that case, it's a brilliant tool. It's really powerful. It can be really incredible. But using it for personalized financial advice, I don't think it's quite there yet."" Holeman's caution is notable given that Betterment helped pioneer robo-advising. Founded in 2008 and launched in 2010, Betterment helped define the direct-to-consumer automated investing model that many firms later adopted. ""We don't use AI for our financial advice currently,"" he said. ""We're looking into it. We've seen a lot of promise, but it can act a little bit odd when you start to get into some really technical details."" Read more: Retirement planning: A step-by-step guide AI ""hallucinations"" — confidently stated inaccuracies — are improving, he said, but they remain a concern. ""Large language models weren't really built to do math,"" Holeman said. ""We’re seeing that get a little bit better as well, but still a little bit of concern there. So it's moving incredibly fast. I think we're not far away from it, but we're just not seeing that widespread adoption quite yet."" Artificial intelligence use cases are growing rapidly, but it may be wise to exercise caution when taking financial advice from AI models, Betterment's Nick Holeman said. (Lukas Barth/picture alliance via Getty Images) · picture alliance via Getty Images Still, Holeman acknowledged that AI can be helpful for users who understand financial terms and prompt design. In other words, it can be empowering if you know the right questions to ask. ""Prompt engineering is important, and it's worth exploring because many investors don't even know what to ask,"" he said. ""Once you're dealing with terms like adjusted gross income or anything involving the IRS, it can get pretty complex."" But he added that even savvy AI users and financial advisers would be wise to proceed with caution, especially given the potential tax changes on the horizon and the rapidly evolving political environment. In recent months, Holeman noted that Betterment advisers have witnessed increased client conversations about political uncertainty affecting investment decisions. ""We are seeing an uptick in investors being nervous,"" Holeman said. ""Our investors have been very well behaved with their retirement portfolio that we're not seeing mass panic or sellouts of their existing nest egg, but we are seeing them hold on to cash for a lot longer than usual.""

Trump gets closer to naming his pick to replace Powell as Fed chair,2025-06-26 23:27:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-gets-closer-to-naming-his-pick-to-replace-powell-as-fed-chair-102412459.html,"President Trump is getting closer to naming his replacement for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell as his patience with the central bank chairman runs out. Trump told reporters Wednesday that he is down to three or four candidates. He could announce his pick soon, two people close to the administration told Yahoo Finance. The possibilities, these people said, include former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, former World Bank president David Malpass, and Fed governor Christopher Waller. The Wall Street Journal reported late Wednesday that he could announce his final pick by September or October — or even this summer — to undercut Powell’s authority for the remainder of his term ending in May 2026. The Journal also reported on the list of possible candidates. ""I know within three or four people who I’m going to pick,"" the president said Wednesday without offering specific names. Steve Moore, a longtime adviser to the president, told Yahoo Finance that Trump does want to announce his pick sometime soon, and that he does view it as a shot over the bow at Powell. Warsh, Hassett, Bessent and Malpass are all under consideration, he added, but Waller is not because he voted to keep rates on hold at the last central bank meeting. Another person close to the administration said late September is possible timing for an announcement, and that Bessent, Hassett, Waller and Malpass are under consideration but that the president is souring on Warsh. A White House official said no Fed chairman decisions are imminent, although the president has the right to change his mind and he has many good options for the post. This is not the first time that an early pick to replace Powell has been floated. Before Trump was elected, Bessent in 2024 floated the idea of naming a ""shadow chair"" well before Powell's term was up, ensuring that ""no one is really going to care what Jerome Powell has to say anymore."" Bessent told lawmakers earlier this month he would like to remain in his seat until 2029, but he did not dismiss the possibility of becoming the next chair of the Fed. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent speaks with reporters on Tuesday. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) · Tom Williams via Getty Images Bessent said he has ""the best job"" in Washington and is ""happy to do what President Trump wants me to do,"" while noting that he ""would like to stay in my seat through 2029"" to help carry out the administration’s agenda. Council of Economic Advisers chair Stephen Miran in a Yahoo Finance interview Thursday dismissed the chances of any economic fallout that could come from such a potential move by Trump to announce a ""shadow"" chair. ""I don't know that I see risks to the economy from what the administration does on this stuff, as you know the Federal Reserve sets interest rates and so the primary risks to the economy are from what's actually going on with interest rates not from anything that we do or do not do on that front,"" he told Yahoo Finance. The active consideration of Powell successors comes after a period of intensifying pressure from Trump as the Fed chair’s guarded wait-and-see monetary policy stance continues to inflame tensions with the White House. The president has called repeatedly for rate cuts and lobbed a series of insults at Powell via social media, from ""loser"" to ""fool."" Read more: How the Fed rate decision affects your bank accounts, loans, credit cards, and investments Trump’s comments on Wednesday didn’t address the question of whether he is looking to fire Powell or announce his final pick quickly. Last week the president mused : ""Maybe, just maybe, I'll have to change my mind about firing him?"" Powell has said he intends to serve out his term as chair and that he can't be removed by law. ""He goes out pretty soon, fortunately, because I think he's terrible,"" Trump added Wednesday. President Donald Trump. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) · ASSOCIATED PRESS The comments from the president came as Powell sat before Senate lawmakers for his second day of regularly scheduled testimony before Congress. Powell told lawmakers that the central bank is ""well-positioned to wait"" on any interest rate adjustments until it has more clarity on how Trump's tariffs will affect inflation and the direction of the US economy. Read more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet The president's attacks on Powell intensified at the end of last week as Trump called for rates to drop from 4.25% to 4.5% to between 1% and 2% and said of Powell and the Fed's board of governors, ""I don't know why the Board doesn’t override this Total and Complete Moron!"" Trump repeated some of those points in a Tuesday social media post , calling for rates ""at least two to three points lower"" and saying that Powell ""will be in Congress today in order to explain, among other things, why he is refusing to lower the Rate."" ""I hope Congress really works this very dumb, hardheaded person, over. We will be paying for his incompetence for many years to come."" On Wednesday, Trump reiterated his oft-stated case for why Powell should lower rates by at least one percentage point immediately, citing ""no inflation."" U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testifies before a Senate committee on Wednesday. REUTERS/Kevin Mohatt · REUTERS / Reuters He also recounted an earlier face-to-face meeting with Powell, offering a mocking voice for Powell, and repeated his personal attacks by saying ""I think he's a very stupid person actually"" and calling him ""an average mentally person."" Trump is not the only one calling for lower rates following the last meeting on June 18-19, when all central bank officials voted to keep rates unchanged for the fourth consecutive time. Even some of Powell's fellow policymakers — Fed governors Michelle Bowman and Waller — have said in recent days that they now see cutting rates as soon as the Fed's next policy meeting in July due to recent mild inflation readings. But other officials have pushed back on that urgency and warned that it is too soon to know the true effects of tariffs on inflation. Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Thomas Barkin said Thursday tariffs likely to push inflation up over coming months, even though ""I don’t expect the impact on inflation to be anywhere near as significant as what we just experienced” during the Covid-19 pandemic. Trump has even mused about appointing himself Fed chair. One lawmaker asked Powell on Tuesday if that was even possible. ""I don’t know,"" Powell said, adding that it's ""not a question for me."" Powell has not said if he also plans to leave the Fed's board after his chairmanship is up next May. His term as a Fed governor is not up until 2028. And on Tuesday and Wednesday, he repeatedly dodged questions about Trump, Trump's policies, and the president's string of personal insults. ""All I want to do in what’s left of my time at the Fed is to have the economy be strong and have inflation be under control. I want to turn it over to my successor in that condition.""

Tech optimism is reaching 1999 levels — but with a few key differences,2025-06-26 19:00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-optimism-is-reaching-1999-levels--but-with-a-few-key-differences-100006830.html,"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings Tech's back at it . It wasn't that long ago that fears of a Chinese startup's AI advancements channeled a mix of anxieties about overblown tech stocks. Along with a trade war. Several storylines — from reckless AI spending to sky-high valuations — folded neatly into an argument that maybe this was the one step back after the two steps forward over the past couple of years. But after a bout of plunging stock prices, Big Tech has mounted a comeback and then some. The off-the-charts excitement now that a suite of catalysts — trade war, Iran/Israel, and Fed cut hopes — have been put to the side is palpable. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Morning Brief Subscribe By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Right now, as DataTrek's Nicholas Colas put it, ""a bullish call on US large caps therefore requires believing that we can get to 1999-type valuations."" It's a charged date to throw into the mix, invoking the exuberance that led up to the dot-com bubble. But as Colas noted, there are key differences for investors to consider even if stocks are partying like it's 1999. At the peak of the internet bubble, the benchmark S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) traded at more than 24 times forward year earnings estimates. As Colas noted, the index currently trades at 23 times this year’s numbers and 20.3 times next year’s consensus estimate. To see the bullish calls like the 10% gain from current levels we just got from BMO's Brian Belski, the multiple, depending on exactly how quarterly results go, could surpass that level. (Belski's model has a 24.4x ratio.) That comparison may feel scary and bubbly, but there are a lot of reasons to be an optimist these days, despite the swirling negative catalysts and the lingering sense that trouble is around the corner. As Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week , the ""US economy has defied all kinds of forecasts for it to weaken."" Of course, plenty of bets won't pan out. Some estimates say that a huge portion of AI projects will vanish in a few years , and it'd be normal for emerging tech to have winners and losers. And as for the winners, well, you already know their names. They're powering the S&P 500. Colas noted that this year has a much more positive setup than 1999, with rate cuts on the horizon and greater S&P tech exposure. The historic frames are different. So are the underlying technologies driving growth and producing actual profits, and reasons more will follow. But the bullish sentiment feels familiar. That's what makes tech's latest surge so thrilling and disconcerting after the spring we've just had. As tech stocks grasp for new highs, it's difficult to tell if this is the precipice of a pullback or the staging for the next leg upward. The stock prices, however, leave the market's view on it pretty clear. Hamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy. Follow Hamza on X @hshaban .

Nvidia stock notches fresh record high in remarkable 2025 turnaround,2025-06-26 18:10:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-notches-fresh-record-high-in-remarkable-2025-turnaround-200401502.html,"Nvidia stock ( NVDA ) rose more than 4% Wednesday to notch a new record high of $154.31, completing a remarkable turnaround from earlier this year. The chipmaker's stock was up over 1% in premarket trading on Thursday. Nvidia shares previously hit a record close of $149.43 on Jan. 6. The stock's gain also saw shares reach a fresh intraday high during Wednesday's trading session. The AI chipmaker’s stock has seen a significant upswing following its first quarter earnings in late May, which featured revenue that beat Wall Street’s expectations and showed the company continuing to thrive despite a new export ban on sales of its chips to one of its largest markets: China. Read more about Nvidia's stock moves and today's market action. Shares have jumped more than 14% since Nvidia’s May 28 earnings report, far ahead of the S&P 500’s ( ^GSPC ) roughly 3.4% gain in that time frame. Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah on Wednesday raised his price target on Nvidia stock to $250, the highest of Wall Street analysts tracked by Yahoo Finance. The new price target suggests Nvidia's market cap could soar to $6 trillion from its current $3.6 trillion level. ""While it may seem fantastic that NVDA fundamentals can continue to amplify from current levels, we remind folks that NVDA remains essentially a monopoly for critical tech, and that it has pricing (and margin) power,"" Baruah wrote in a note to clients, adding that Loop Capital analysts see the market for AI chips growing to $2 trillion in 2028. To be sure, questions remain over whether AI infrastructure demand will continue to rise, as Big Tech companies rake in far less revenue than they're spending to build the tech. Nvidia stock had struggled in the months following its record close in January as President Trump embarked on his trade war and artificial intelligence competition in China rattled the broader markets. Nvidia shares plunged in late January when a new cheap AI model from Chinese startup DeepSeek prompted demand concerns for its AI chips. Then, the stock plummeted again in April as Trump's steep tariff announcements rocked the stock market . Trump enacted a ban on sales of Nvidia’s H20 chips to China, costing the chipmaker $2.5 billion in lost revenue in the first quarter and a projected $8 billion loss in the second quarter.

(Sarah Meyssonnier/Pool via AP) · ASSOCIATED PRESS At the same time, Nvidia's competition in the Chinese market was heating up from domestic tech giant Huawei. Huawei is reportedly readying a new advanced AI chip that would be competitive with Nvidia's prior-generation H100 chips. Shares hit their lowest closing price in over a year on April 4, ending the trading session at just over $94. Before the chipmaker's first quarter earnings report, Nvidia stock was bolstered in May by deals with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to supply hundreds of thousands of its AI chips to the countries. The stock’s comeback helped it briefly overtake Microsoft ( MSFT ) as the world’s most valuable company in early June. The upswing comes as investors pile back into tech stocks. Bank of America analysts said in a note Tuesday that tech inflows hit their highest level last week since June 2024.

The Nasdaq Composite climbed about 0.3%, boosted by Nvidia’s ( NVDA ) 4% rise that helped the chipmaker secure a record closing price . The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) flirted with its own all-time highs but ended the trading day nearly flat, just below its record level. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones ( ^DJI ) slipped about 0.3%, falling just over 100 points. Stocks lost steam as Powell testified before the Senate Banking Committee in his second day of congressional testimony. He tangled with Republican senators amid pressure from the GOP side, most prominently from Trump himself, to cut rates. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that inflation from tariffs is still an open question, noting the central bank is closely watching upcoming economic data to assess the impact on monetary policy. ""There will be some inflation from tariffs coming, not yet, but over the course of the coming months,"" Powell said. Markets responded positively to Powell's prior day testimony, where he hinted that rate cuts could come ""sooner rather than later."" His remarks set the stage for Friday’s closely watched release of the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report, which investors will scrutinize for clues on the future path of monetary policy. Economists expect annual ""core"" PCE — which strips out volatile food and energy costs — to have ticked up in May, compared with April . But scrutiny will also fall on any signs that Trump's tariffs pushed prices higher . Investors are also keeping a close eye on the US-brokered Middle East truce, which appears to be holding. There have been no reported strikes between Israel and Iran since Trump lambasted both for breaching an agreement to pause hostilities to give room for diplomacy.

Wed, June 25, 2025 at 8:04 PM UTC Laura Bratton Nvidia stock notches new record high Nvidia shares rose over 4% to end Wednesday's trading session above $154, notching a new record high. Nvidia hit its prior record close of $149.43 on Jan. 6. Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah on Wednesday raised his price target on Nvidia stock to $250, the highest of Wall Street analysts tracked by Yahoo Finance. The new price target suggests Nvidia's market cap could soar to $6 trillion from its current $3.6 trillion level. ""While it may seem fantastic that NVDA fundamentals can continue to amplify from current levels, we remind folks that NVDA remains essentially a monopoly for critical tech, and that it has pricing (and margin) power,"" Baruah wrote in a note to clients, adding that Loop Capital analysts see the market for AI chips growing to $2 trillion in 2028. To be sure, questions remain over whether AI infrastructure demand will continue to rise, as Big Tech companies rake in far less revenue than they're spending to build the tech. Read more here. Wed, June 25, 2025 at 7:17 PM UTC Josh Schafer The S&P 500 isn't as expensive as it was in 2021 The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) is back near record highs, which means a familiar talking point is also back in the market discussion. The S&P 500's valuation is back above both the five- and 10-year averages. This is often used as a way to describe stocks as ""expensive."" But as we've pointed out in the past, just because valuations are high doesn't mean they can't stay high for an extended period of time. It also doesn't mean they can't keep moving higher. The chart below from Exhibit A co-founder Matt Cerminaro shows that when splitting the S&P 500 into deciles organized by least and most expensive, the current market is far less expensive than the peak of the 2021 stock boom. For instance, the average stock in the most expensive bucket is trading at a 63 times forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio, well below the 104 times forward earnings seen back in 2021. ""Price earnings multiples are a function of investor confidence, which is a constantly moving target and has very little in the way of natural limits on either the upside or downside,"" DataTrek co-Founder Nicholas Colas wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.

Wednesday's action is headlined by a 4% Nvidia rise in Nvidia ( NVDA ), but over the past month, the tech trade has been about much more than the ""Magnificent Seven."" The technology sector has actually outperformed both the S&P 500 and the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF ( MAGS ), which includes Nvidia, Apple ( AAPL ), Alphabet ( GOOGL , GOOG ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Meta ( META ), Tesla ( TSLA ). Inside the technology sector, other names have been leading with Oracle ( ORCL ) and Micron ( MU ) at the top of the list, rising 36% over the past month. Wed, June 25, 2025 at 6:01 PM UTC Laura Bratton Stocks reverse gains as Fed chair Jerome Powell warns of tariff-fueled inflation In his second day of testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell again said that President Trump's tariffs could fuel inflation , arguing the central bank is in good position to ""wait"" and see their effects. Though Powell said ""inflation's in a really good place,"" he added that ""there will be some inflation from tariffs coming, not yet, but over the course of the coming months."" ""And I think it is reasonable to expect that because someone has to pay,"" he said. ""This is hundreds of billions of dollars of tariffs we're taking in. Some of that's going to fall on the consumer."" The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) pulled back from slight gains, down just over 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) dropped 0.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) was up 0.1%. Markets had gotten a boost Tuesday from Powell's comments to Congress , when he said policymakers could act ""sooner rather than later"" on rate cuts.

Shares of the Campbell's Soup maker have dropped nearly 29% over the past year, while the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) has gained more than 11%. The company's earnings have declined in each of the past three quarters. In March, the stock dropped after Campbell's cut its full year outlook , citing softer demand for its snack brands, which include Goldfish and Kettle chips.

Wed, June 25, 2025 at 5:07 PM UTC Laura Bratton AI data center market to reach over $820 billion in 2030, BofA says Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya said in a report Wednesday that artificial intelligence could boost the AI data center market to $823 billion by 2030, up from $256 billion in 2025. “We expect every major country/region to invest in creating its independent 'sovereign' AI factory, trained in local language, culture, generating high-tech employment, and serving critical healthcare, defense, industrial, financial and cyber needs,” Arya wrote. Some $650 billion of that market would go to AI chips alone, up from $201 billion in 2025. Nvidia ( NVDA ) is set to be a “key beneficiary” as it’s “still far ahead” of new entrants in the sector, Arya said. To be sure, tech companies are still in the process of figuring out how to monetize AI and are raking in far less revenue than they’re spending to build the tech. For example, a separate analysis from Bank of America on Monday showed that Google’s AI subscriptions are set to drive $4.2 billion in subscription revenue within its Google Cloud segment in 2025. Meanwhile, Google parent Alphabet ( GOOGL , GOOG ) has said it will spend $75 billion in 2025, driven by its investments in AI. Wed, June 25, 2025 at 4:38 PM UTC Ines Ferré BP stock surges on report of talks surrounding acquisition by rival Shell BP ( BP ) stock soared as much as 8% on Wednesday after the Wall Street Journal reported the British oil giant is in early talks to be acquired by its European rival Shell ( SHEL ). According to the report, an agreement would mark a landmark deal between the two energy super majors, valued at $80 billion. BP stock pared gains to rise 1.% after a Shell spokesperson said, “As we have said many times before, we are sharply focused on capturing the value in Shell through continuing to focus on performance, discipline and simplification.” BP declined to comment on the report. Earlier this year, the company announced it would increase oil and gas investments and target divestments to support a stronger balance sheet as the company pivoted its focus back to its core business of oil and gas while lowering spending on renewables. Over the past year, BP came under increasing activist investor pressure to put profits before climate initiatives. Wed, June 25, 2025 at 4:11 PM UTC Laura Bratton Micron stock dips ahead of earnings Micron ( MU ) stock dipped 1.7% ahead of the chipmaker’s third quarter earnings report, which is scheduled to be released after the bell Wednesday. Despite the modest decline, the stock is up 50% for the year. Micron sells its high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips to companies such as Nvidia ( NVDA ) to use within graphics processing units in AI data centers. It also sells other kinds of memory chips that firms like Apple ( AAPL ) use in consumer electronics. “HBM demand trends remain robust with strong visibility and AI capital expenditure spending,” JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur wrote in an earnings preview June 20 of the company, maintaining his Overweight rating on Micron stock. Wall Street analysts expect Micron to report earnings per share of $1.60 for its third quarter, up 158% from the previous year, and revenue of $8.85 billion, a roughly 30% jump from the year-ago period. Two weeks ago, Micron joined a slew of tech companies bolstering their investment in US manufacturing amid broader pressure on the sector from President Trump. Micron said it will invest an additional $30 billion in the US as it looks to build out its manufacturing and research and development facilities in Idaho and New York, bringing its total US manufacturing and R&D investments up to roughly $200 billion, Wed, June 25, 2025 at 3:14 PM UTC Josh Schafer Trump down to '3 or 4' candidates to replace Powell as Fed chair Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul and Jennifer Schonberger reports: President Trump told reporters that he is actively considering replacements for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, and that he is down to three or four candidates. ""I know within 3 or 4 people who I’m going to pick,"" he told reporters adding of Powell ""he goes up pretty soon fortunately because I think he's terrible."" Powell’s term as chair expires in May 2026. The comments from the president during a press conference in the Netherlands came at the same time as Powell sat before Senate lawmakers about 3,800 miles away in Washington for his second day of regularly scheduled testimony before Congress. The consideration of Powell successors comes after a period of intensifying pressure from Trump to consider rate cuts as the chairman’s guarded wait-and-see monetary policy stance continues to inflame tensions with the White House. Trump’s comments on Wednesday didn’t address the question of whether he is looking to fire Powell or announce his final pick quickly in part to undercut Powell’s authority for the remainder of his term.

Wed, June 25, 2025 at 1:23 PM UTC Laura Bratton Reddit stock extends gains after 40% monthly climb Reddit stock ( RDDT ) jumped 5% premarket Wednesday after gaining roughly 5% the previous day. Shares of the social media platform have seen a massive upswing since early June. The stock is up 40% for the month through Tuesday's trading session, and Wednesday's rise would add to that climb. Part of that upswing came as the company launched new AI tools at the Cannes Lions festival and after a recent analysis showed that Reddit is the second-most-cited website in Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ) AI overviews. Despite Reddit stock's climb this week, shares are still down nearly 14% for the year. The social media stock has suffered as changes to Google's Search algorithm have spurred ongoing concerns among investors over its user traffic. Citing an industry contact, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brad Erickson said that ""spend on Reddit is expected to grow as brands recognize the importance of maintaining a presence on the platform,"" especially as AI models impact advertisers by reducing Search traffic to websites. Erickson, who maintained his Sector Perform rating on the stock, also noted that Reddit is cracking down on multiple users using the same account, which could be a ""tailwind"" for traffic. Deutsche Bank analyst Benjamin Black said in a note to clients on June 18 that Reddit has ""a viable strategy to reduce the current top-of-funnel user volatility,"" as ""there appears to be a renewed push to diversify user acquisition channels to platforms beyond Google."" Black reiterated his Buy rating on the stock.

Shares had jumped 2.6% Tuesday and are up nearly 13% over the past month. The AI chipmaker’s stock has seen a significant upswing following its first quarter earnings in late May, which featured revenue that beat Wall Street’s expectations and showed the company continuing to thrive despite a new export ban on sales of its chips to China, one of its largest markets.

The Pillsbury owner's full-year profit forecast was weaker than expected as consumers pulled back on buying snacks and refrigerated baked goods last quarter. Net sales in North America declined 10%, though sales in its pet segment rose 12%, Reuters reported. General Mills expects its adjusted profit to be down 10% to 15% for the full year. My colleague Brooke DiPalma reported that consumers have become choosier about spending on snacks — a trend that has only gotten worse as the year goes on. Shoppers have been buying less, searching for better deals, making fewer impulse purchases, and trading down to private label brands more often as tariff uncertainty and inflation shape spending patterns.

"The White House makes its closing argument for Trump's 'big, beautiful bill': 'Very big' economic benefits",2025-06-26 23:19:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-white-house-makes-its-closing-argument-for-trumps-big-beautiful-bill-very-big-economic-benefits-191518628.html,"The White House is in the process of making its closing argument for President Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" and it involves some eye-popping projections for the US economy that don't line up with the predictions of independent economists. How eye-popping? Try additional economic growth of 4.9% in the short term and up to $11.1 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade if the Senate bill is passed and Trump’s agenda is enacted. ""Those are very big numbers,"" Council of Economic Advisers chair Stephen Miran acknowledged on a call with reporters as he laid out a 27-page report from his group. That report was part of a push from the White House this week as the Senate debates the bill to persuade some wary Republicans to vote yes. It will continue Thursday afternoon with a ""One, Big, Beautiful Event"" scheduled for 4 p.m. ET at the White House, where the president is expected to apply direct political pressure to get the bill done in the coming weeks. Still, the White House's economic findings were immediately met with skepticism by economists who have come to very different conclusions. The report concludes that Trump’s entire ""suite"" of policies — from the bill itself to unilateral deregulation efforts to tariffs — could lead, in Miran's words, to ""very material increases in GDP growth, very material increases in investment activity, and very material increases in real wages and take-home pay."" Stephen Miran is the chairman of Donald Trump's Council of Economic Advisors. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) · ASSOCIATED PRESS The case is essentially that certain provisions in the bill, especially deductions for businesses around things like research and development, will lead to a spike in corporate investment that will then fuel 4.6% to 4.9% in additional GDP growth over the next four years. It is an aggressive projection to say the least with the White House's overall deficit reduction then coming from a range of Trump's policies. ""We calculate that when you add all these things up,"" Miran added in a Yahoo Finance Live interview Thursday ""you get about 8.5 to $11 trillion of deficit reduction over the 10 year budget window."" That would lead to thousands of dollars in additional income for a typical family and stabilize America’s debt-to-GDP ratio, the report adds. The rosy predictions from the White House were immediately slammed by a range of economists. “Well, I guess if you are going to make stuff up, go big or go home,” offered former Democratic Congresswoman Carolyn Bourdeaux. “No credible economist believes this bill is going to reduce the deficit,” she added, noting that “it adds $3+ trillion.” Bourdeaux currently runs the Concord Coalition, a group focused on the national debt. A range of independent projections — from the Congressional Budget Office to the Tax Foundation to the Penn-Wharton Budget Model — have looked at different versions of the bill and reached a similar conclusion of much lower economic growth and a price tag in the neighborhood of $3 trillion over the next decade. The back-and-forth comes after the House passed a first version of the bill last month that was then followed by amendments in the Senate . Senate Majority Leader John Thune hopes to finalize those amendments and put the entire package up for a series of votes starting Friday. The deliberations are also being closely watched by Wall Street, with the megabill also responsible for raising a debt ceiling that is ticking towards a government default as early as Aug. 15, the Bipartisan Policy Center projected in a new report released Wednesday. A frantic final series of negotiations and cost projections The problem for Thune and other Republicans is that a series of fights over different pieces of the bill remain unresolved, with GOP leaders facing a daunting to-do list in the days ahead before another round of voting can begin. In addition to lawmaker objections over issues like state and local tax (SALT) deductions and Medicaid cuts, recent Senate changes already appear likely to increase the price tag further and have further inflamed the concerns of fiscal hawks. A look at the tax provisions of the bill in recent days from the Joint Committee on Taxation offered a new price tag of more than $4 trillion . Wednesday’s White House report offered a breakdown of how officials say the top figure of $11.1 trillion in deficit reduction is achievable, suggesting that roughly $2.1-2.2 trillion in deficit declines come from the bill itself. Other cost savings will come from additional reductions in discretionary spending (about $1.8 trillion) and more tariff revenue (another $3.2 trillion). The tariff revenue figure is an increase from a recent Congressional Budget Office calculation of $2.8 trillion in revenues, but only if tariffs stay at current levels for the next decade. The final piece of the report focused on deregulatory and energy policies. The White House concluded those steps could reduce the deficit by an additional $1.3 trillion to $3.7 trillion over the coming decade. The new numbers further reinforced a divide between economists and the White House. After the House bill was released, there was an $11 trillion chasm between what economists said the bill’s effects would be and what the White House said Trump’s agenda would bring. The divide is now even wider, with $15 trillion separating projections released in recent days from each side. The bill is ""far from deficit neutral,"" added Heather Boushey, a former member of Joe Biden's Council of Economic Advisors, on Wednesday afternoon. ""There are a lot of shenanigans in how they are calculating their numbers."" This story has been updated with additional developments. Ben Werschkul is a Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.

Meta’s quest to dominate the AI world,2025-06-30 00:25:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/metas-quest-to-dominate-the-ai-world-184836143.html,"Facebook parent Meta ( META ) is spending billions of dollars to grab the lead in the AI race, building out the data centers needed to develop and power high-end large language models. And now, the company is pouring billions more into snatching up top talent and technologies to grab the lead in the AI wars. In its latest hiring coup, Meta has poached three OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) researchers — Google DeepMind alums Lucas Beyer, Alexander Kolesnikov, and Xiaohua Zhai — from its Zurich office, The Wall Street Journal reported late Wednesday. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman claims that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has offered the company's employees upward of $100 million to join his AI efforts. Meanwhile, Meta is reportedly in talks to bag Safe Superintelligence CEO Daniel Gross and former Github CEO Nat Friedman for its planned superintelligence lab. Zuckerberg was initially eyeing all of Safe Superintelligence, but was shot down by co-founder Ilya Sutskever, according to CNBC . The moves come after Meta invested $14.3 billion in AI startup Scale AI and hired its CEO and co-founder Alexandr Wang. That’s not all: Meta also wanted to buy Perplexity AI ( PEAI.PVT ) but couldn’t come to terms on a deal. “Meta is doing this because they want to win the AI race, period,” Forrester analyst Mike Proulx told Yahoo Finance. “AI is everything right now.” All of this follows Meta’s decision to postpone the debut of its massive Llama 4 Behemoth AI model. According to The Wall Street Journal , the company won’t launch the model until later this fall over concerns that it isn’t a big enough upgrade over prior models. Scale AI founder and CEO Alexandr Wang poses for photos at the company's office in San Francisco, May 15, 2023. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) · ASSOCIATED PRESS “I think this is two things: No. 1 [is] confirmation that Llama is struggling,” Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance. “And second, is [it’s] also a sign that Zuckerberg is not OK with that.” For Meta, the goal is clear: bring in as much fresh talent as possible to push its AI program forward and take the lead in the AI wars. Meta’s AI moves Meta’s effort to rule the AI world differs from its chief rivals, OpenAI, Google, xAI, and others. Rather than closing off its AI models, the company offers them as open-source software that developers and companies can use on their own. Meta imposes some restrictions on how users can take advantage of its models. For instance, the company requires firms to request a license from Meta if their product has more than 700 million monthly active users. Regardless, Meta’s ultimate goal is to get as many people as it’s comfortable with using and developing products via its AI models. Why not charge everyone who wants to access its software? Because Meta benefits every time a company alters its models, giving it greater insights into how it can improve them down the line. Microsoft Chairman & CEO Satya Nadella, left, and Meta Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg walk on stage at LlamaCon 2025, an AI developer conference, in Menlo Park, Calif., Tuesday, April 29, 2025. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) · ASSOCIATED PRESS Meta isn’t terribly interested in selling access to its models, either. The company primarily uses its AI to power its advertising and content recommendation services, unlike, say, Microsoft ( MSFT ), which sells its AI services as part of its productivity software packages, among other things. Meta CFO Susan Li told investors during the company’s most recent earnings call that it saw a 4% increase in user time spent on the Threads app since introducing Llama to its recommendation systems at the end of last year. Meta is also leaning on its AI models to provide the intelligence for its hardware products including its Ray-Ban Meta smartglasses and other future AI-powered devices. “Why Meta is making these moves is that they've got a ton of money, and so with that money, they are in a good position to, if they can't build it themselves, acquire the talent and capabilities necessary to …leapfrog the competition,” Proulx explained. But Meta isn’t the only company circling Silicon Valley’s AI upstarts. Apple is also reportedly looking into bagging its own AI company as the iPhone maker looks to improve its own AI fortunes. Apple was supposed to release an AI-powered version of Siri earlier this year, but has pushed the rollout until later this year as it contends with its own development difficulties. To that end, Apple has also discussed purchasing Perplexity AI, according to Bloomberg . While a spokesperson for Perplexity said the company has no knowledge of current or future M&A discussions, they added, “It shouldn’t be a surprise that the best OEMs in the world want to offer the best search and most accurate AI for their users, and that’s Perplexity.” Apple rival Samsung is also reportedly looking to add Perplexity to its devices . For Meta, it will all come down to whether it can woo the right people from the right AI firms to join its AI push and catapult the company into the pole position in the AI race. If it can’t, the social media giant could find itself falling further without a clear path forward.

Big banks are closer to getting one of biggest regulatory rollbacks since 2008,2025-06-26 03:56:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-banks-are-closer-to-getting-one-of-biggest-regulatory-rollbacks-since-2008-174007357.html,"US regulators on Wednesday proposed one of the most dramatic rollbacks of bank capital rules since the 2008 financial crisis, which would give a major victory to lenders seeking relief from the new Trump administration. The proposed change would alter the so-called enhanced supplementary leverage ratio (eSLR), a rule that calls for the largest US banks to hold additional minimum capital based solely on their size. The largest and most important US lenders, such as JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ), Bank of America ( BAC ), Goldman Sachs Group ( GS ), and Morgan Stanley ( MS ), currently must keep those eSLR ratios at 5%. The proposal unveiled by regulators Wednesday would lower that requirement for big bank holding companies by 1.4 percentage points, or approximately $13 billion. The ratio would drop by 10 percentage points for the lenders' bank subsidiaries, according to officials. The change to this key capital ratio is designed to make it easier for banks to lend more freely and help create an even bigger pool of buyers for US Treasurys. Banks have complained this ratio penalizes them for holding lower-risk assets such as Treasury bonds. The Federal Reserve governors approved the proposal Wednesday in a 5-2 vote, meaning it now will be put out for public comment. Two other regulatory agencies, FDIC and OCC, also collaborated on the proposal. ""Today’s proposal is an important first step in balancing the stability of the financial system and Treasury market resilience, while preserving safety and soundness,"" the Fed's new top banking regulator, Michelle Bowman, said in a statement. Not everyone is on board, however. Two Fed governors — Michael Barr and Adriana Kugler — are objected to the proposal based on their views that the benefits to easing the capital constraint for the Treasury market doesn't outweigh the financial stability risks. ""I believe this reduction in capital requirements at the bank subsidiaries of the nation’s largest and most complex banking organizations will increase systemic risk in a manner that is not justified,"" Kugler said in a statement. Barr added in a separate statement that this would reduce bank subsidiary capital by $210 billion for the systemically important institutions. ""Firms will likely use the proposal to distribute capital to shareholders and engage in the highest return activities available to them, rather than to meaningfully increase Treasury intermediation,"" he said. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent previously signaled that regulators were close to easing this capital rule as part of a broader deregulatory push by the Trump administration. Such an adjustment would be ""broadly positive for the biggest banks,"" TD analyst Jaret Seiberg said in a recent research note. He added that it would help ""the traditional trading banks more than the traditional commercial banks."" But Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren warned that loosening capital requirements would make the financial system less safe. ""The last thing we should be doing is granting Wall Street’s number one deregulatory wish by weakening a rule that helps prevent megabank failures, taxpayer bailouts, and economic devastation,"" she said in a statement. ""The enhanced supplementary leverage ratio promotes lending and ensures that big bank shareholders have more of their own skin in the game to absorb losses when their risky bets blow up. Claims that this policy helps the Treasury market are just misdirection."" More regulatory changes for big banks could still be on the way. Bowman, who is the Fed's vice chair for supervision, made it clear in a speech Monday that revisiting the eSLR requirement is just the start of broader capital rollback considerations. Federal Reserve Board Governor Michelle Bowman, who also acts as the Fed's vice chair for supervision. REUTERS/Kevin Mohatt · REUTERS / Reuters ""This proposal takes a first step toward what I view as long overdue follow-up to review and reform what have become distorted capital requirements,"" said Bowman, the Fed’s vice chair for supervision and a Fed governor. Other capital requirements under consideration for future adjustment include the surcharge on global systemically important banks and the various asset thresholds that determine which banks face what rules. This will undoubtedly please the bosses of some giant banks, including JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who has called for regulators to revisit many of their rules. On July 22, the Fed will host a conference to bring together leaders to discuss the capital framework for US banks. The Fed also said Monday it will no longer consider reputation risk as part of its bank exams, in another sign of a readjustment under new leadership. ""Regulations should not be created in a static world of 'set it and forget it,'"" said Bowman, who also noted that “a solid capital foundation in the banking system is critical to support safety and soundness and financial stability.” JPMorgan Chase CEO and Chairman Jamie Dimon, who has called for a broad rethink of bank capital rules. REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein · REUTERS / Reuters Big banks and their D.C. lobbyists have long taken issue with the unintended constraints of their leverage capital requirements, which can serve as handcuffs during times of stress. This came to a head at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 when US monetary and fiscal policy rapidly expanded the $30 trillion market for US Treasurys and banks acting as intermediaries between the government and investors could not catch up. “Simple reforms to return leverage ratio requirements to their traditional role as a capital backstop could improve Treasury market functioning by building resilience in advance of future stress events,” Bowman said Monday. Bowman also noted that this could reduce the chances that the Fed would need to intervene in Treasury markets during chaotic periods. As far back as February, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has also voiced his concern about Treasury market liquidity, pointing to reducing the supplementary leverage ratio as an “obvious thing to do.” Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"
HPE CEO pushes back on tech slowdown fears despite signs of caution from CIOs,2025-06-26 02:32:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hpe-ceo-pushes-back-on-tech-slowdown-fears-despite-signs-of-caution-from-cios-173230961.html,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise ( HPE ) CEO Antonio Neri said there has been no slowdown in IT spending. ""Momentum is across all business lines,"" Neri told Yahoo Finance while speaking at the company's annual Discover Conference in Las Vegas. He noted that networking solutions, a part of HPE's core offerings, are needed to deploy more AI and cloud applications. ""We see that growth in our orders, and now in our revenue,"" he added. Neri also pointed to continued growth in enterprise demand, particularly around AI and hybrid cloud services. He highlighted HPE's deepening partnership with Nvidia ( NVDA ) to expand so-called AI factories — infrastructure needed to build, deploy, and scale AI models — as a key driver for growth. But the view from CIOs may be more cautious. According to a new report from KeyBanc Capital Markets, IT budget expectations have slipped. The firm now forecasts IT budgets to grow just 2.7% in 2025, down from 3.9% at the start of the year. If that holds, it would mark the slowest IT budget growth period since 2020. The firm noted broader restraint in the sector. Software vendors are seeing increased scrutiny, and IT hiring plans have scaled back. Major tech employers like Google's parent company, Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ), and Salesforce ( CRM ) have reduced headcounts following a post-pandemic hiring spree. In March, HPE announced a cost-cutting plan targeting $350 million in savings by 2027, primarily through workforce reductions . Tariff-related uncertainty has also weighed on IT. While KeyBanc initially expected 33% of CIOs to say they are being impacted, 42% now report a negative effect. Still, only 19% said they’ve delayed spending, suggesting companies are cautious but not pulling back entirely. HPE beat Wall Street's expectations in its fiscal second quarter , with revenue of $7.6 billion, up 6% year over year, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.38, down 10% year over year. Its intelligent edge segment, which includes networking, had a 7% jump in revenue compared to the prior year, and the hybrid cloud segment grew 13%. The company's pressured server business was responsible for the bulk of its sales at $4.1 billion, a 6% increase over the prior year. Meanwhile, HPE is facing a lawsuit from the Department of Justice over its proposed $14 billion Juniper Networks ( JNPR ) acquisition, with a trial set to begin on July 9. HPE first announced the deal in January 2024. The DOJ blocked the move due to concerns that it would reduce competition and stifle innovation. Neri remains optimistic. ""We believe we will prevail in court if we go all the way there,"" he said. StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.

QuantumScape stock soars 35% on battery production breakthrough,2025-06-26 02:23:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quantumscape-stock-soars-35-on-battery-production-breakthrough-172316144.html,"Battery developer QuantumScape ( QS ) announced a breakthrough in its process for manufacturing solid-state lithium-metal batteries, sending the stock more than 32% higher in early afternoon trading on Wednesday. QuantumScape is one of several companies racing to commercialize next-generation batteries for electric vehicles and other uses. On Tuesday, the US-based startup said it had successfully made its Cobra ceramic separator process the standard in its battery cell production, demonstrating that the improved manufacturing process could work on its assembly lines. The company touted the efficiency gains of Cobra, saying the process treats battery cell components 25 times faster than earlier processes at a fraction of the equipment footprint. The production upgrade lays the foundation for scaling solid-state battery production — potentially to the gigafactory level — while delivering improvements in battery life, charging speed, and cost. ""By significantly improving throughput and shrinking the equipment footprint, Cobra gives us a powerful path forward for commercializing our next-generation battery technology,"" QuantumScape CEO Siva Sivaram said in the release. UKRAINE - 2021/03/25: In this photo illustration the QuantumScape logo is seen on a smartphone and a pc screen. (Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) · SOPA Images via Getty Images Solid-state batteries are considered the ""holy grail"" for EVs, with the technology linked to lighter-weight modules that can hold more energy, discharge more power, and charge faster. In addition to energy efficiency, the promise of lower costs compared to traditional cell-based batteries is one that sent QuantumScape stock surging back in 2020, but it has dropped 42% over the past five years, even including Wednesday's move. The development also has some implications for automakers, notably Volkswagen ( VWAGY ), looking to commercialize cheaper and more efficient batteries in their EVs. Volkswagen, an investor in QuantumScape since 2012, struck a deal with the startup last year to license QuantumScape's manufacturing technology for the mass production of solid-state batteries. Over the past decade, Volkswagen has invested $380 million in the company and has a 24% stake in the startup, according to its annual report. QuantumScape stated that it has also signed sampling agreements with other OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), from major manufacturers to luxury automakers.

China is a real threat to US biotech innovation: EY life science expert,2025-06-26 01:19:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-is-a-real-threat-to-us-biotech-innovation-ey-life-science-expert-161927901.html,"China's growing biotech prowess has become a real threat to the industry in the US in recent years. Moves by the Trump administration could weaken the US market further, according to several experts watching the deals flowing into China, which amounted $30 billion in 2024 and are already more than half that total in mid-2025. EY life sciences leader Arda Ural is among those watching and said that China is no longer the land of generics and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) used by the rest of the world. China has long been known as a ""me too"" producer — that is, a manufacturer of generics — as well as a source of APIs. But China is showing its might as it clinches more licensing deals for drugs developed domestically and increases clinical trials being conducted in the country. ""The numbers are pretty compelling,"" Ural told Yahoo Finance. ""A couple of years ago, we had pretty much no deals, or maybe under $1 billion in 2016. As of last year, there were $30 billion of licensing deals of Chinese assets into the US."" But this didn't happen overnight. The Chinese Communist Party laid out a roadmap in 2015 that included investing in and growing the country's biotech sector. Ten years later, that is coming to fruition, Ural said. A view of the WuXi AppTec logo on an R&D building in Shanghai, China. (Long Wei/Feature China/Future Publishing via Getty Images) · Feature China via Getty Images ""That journey now is taking them upstream to more advanced innovation. Probably, we still have not seen first-in-class, but clearly they are going for best-in-class,"" Ural said. US companies buying or licensing products from China include a due diligence process, which can involve head-to-head comparisons to existing drugs or repeating clinical trials to ensure the data and efficacy results are accurate. This has helped ease concerns about intellectual property theft of US products, as well as concerns about data integrity in China. The prior doubts spurred the introduction of the Biosecure Act in Congress in 2023, which would prevent any entity receiving federal funds from using biotech equipment or services from ""companies of concern."" That bill has stalled in Congress. Meanwhile, the life sciences community continues to increase its interest in China. Companies like WuXi Biologics ( WXXWY ), WuXi AppTec ( WUXAY ), and BGI (formerly Beijing Genomics Institute) are among those under the spotlight. And during the pandemic, companies like CanSino ( 6185.HK ), which developed a vaccine, came into view. Now, with cuts to research funding in the US to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) , as well as the loss of Food and Drug Administration staff, insiders are warning that China could fill the gaps and scoop up talent from the US. ""The US still has the capacity to invest, but it is not, potentially, the only game in town,"" Ural said. He explained that China is still early in its journey, and while it does have government funding and Western-educated doctors and researchers, it doesn't have the type of firepower of US capital markets. ""That is where they are lacking. There is no IPO market comparable to Western markets, there is no M&A exit strategy ... so that's the opportunity for them to come up,"" Ural said. A majority of the deals so far are US-based companies buying early-stage assets from Chinese company pipelines , bringing them to the US to validate and then produce and sell. At the same time, the US-based biotech industry has seen a slowdown in investment and IPO activity, and the NIH funding cuts by the Trump administration are exacerbating the dry spell. China's growth is also adding to the pressure since China is known for making things cheaper and faster than Western countries . Ural said that's why the partnership with US-based firms is a ""winning strategy"" for the overall industry. StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.

Tesla stock slides as European sales in May drop for fifth straight month,2025-06-25 23:53:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-slides-as-european-sales-in-may-drop-for-fifth-straight-month-145309561.html,"Tesla's ( TSLA ) recent high-profile robotaxi test in Austin, Texas, comes as more negative data emerges in its core auto business, with the company's stock dropping in the process. Per the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA), Tesla EV registrations (a proxy for sales) in Europe fell 27.9% to 13,863 in May compared to a year ago. Meanwhile, overall EV registrations in the region, which includes the UK and the European Free Trade Association, rose 25% in May, with overall registrations down 0.6%. May's total marks the fifth straight month of declining Tesla sales in the European region. May's total was better than the fall seen in April, however, when sales dropped a whopping 49% year over year. Tesla stock was down over 5% in early trade. Read more about Tesla's stock moves and today's market action. The wider availability of the Tesla Model Y may have helped, but sales numbers in May were down compared to April. Tesla sales year to date in Europe through May are down 37.1% to 75,196 units. Reuters' report of country-specific data was not confidence-building. France's PFA national auto lobby reported new Tesla registrations dropped 67% in May to 721 units, with overall sales down 47% year to date. Mobility Sweden reported Tesla EV registrations tumbled 53.7% to 503 units in the country in May from a year earlier. Reuters reported Tesla registrations fell 30.5% in Denmark, 36% in the Netherlands, 19% in Spain, and a massive 68% in Portugal. Norway was the only territory in Europe to show sales gains for May. Demand weakness in the EU came after CEO Elon Musk's foray into Trump administration politics, causing some Tesla owners to become disillusioned with him, specifically by his right-leaning tendencies, support of right-wing leaders in Europe, and leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in the US. Musk's recent return to his businesses from politics is seen as a welcome move, per analysts, including Wedbush's Dan Ives, but many wonder if Musk's escapades will permanently damage Tesla's reputation. Musk's recent attacks on President Trump now have both liberals and conservatives upset with the mercurial CEO. Tesla does not report sales by region or monthly, meaning next week's second quarter production and delivery report will be a big one. Read more: How to avoid Tesla car insurance sticker shock Last week, Wells Fargo's Colin Langan wrote in a note to investors that Tesla's fundamentals are coming in worse than expected. The bank is expecting second quarter deliveries to be down 21% compared to a year ago, with the firm's 343,000 estimate approximately 17% below the Street consensus of 411,000. In the first quarter, traditionally a weak one for Tesla, the company reported 336,681 deliveries versus 390,342 estimated, per Bloomberg consensus, making it the worst quarter for deliveries since the second quarter of 2022. Interestingly, while EV sales in Europe continue chugging higher, though not at breakneck speed, there is an indication that the EV transformation occurring in the biggest market, China, could be slowing down. Reuters reports that China's BYD ( 1211.HK ), the biggest producer of EVs and plug-ins by volume, has slowed its production and expansion in recent months by ""reducing shifts at some factories in China and delaying plans to add new production lines."" Sources told Reuters that BYD canceled night shifts and reduced output by at least a third at four of its seven factories in China. BYD sold 4.27 million cars last year globally and is targeting 5.5 million this year, Reuters said. StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.

New Vanguard report: Americans are saving for retirement at record levels,2025-06-29 21:50:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/new-vanguard-report-americans-are-saving-for-retirement-at-record-levels-143530445.html,"Americans set aside an all-time high portion of their paycheck in their 401(k) accounts last year, according to Vanguard's ""How America Saves 2025"" report. On average, Americans saved 7.7% of their paycheck in their employer-provided retirement plan last year — a record high — and nearly half of participants juiced up their savings rate, up from 39% who did so in 2022.

When you kick in employer contributions, the average total participant contribution rate was 12%, up from 11.3% four years ago, per Vanguard. ""That's a very good thing because what flows from that are positive retirement outcomes,"" David Stinnett, head of strategic retirement consulting at Vanguard, told Yahoo Finance. ""We recommend saving 12%-15% of your income for retirement,"" he added. ""This year's total average savings rate puts workers in that range."" Vanguard's annual report unpacks the retirement savings behaviors of nearly 5 million American workers. The big news: The impact of target-date retirement funds on savings. But the report wasn't a complete knock 'em out of the park for savers due to a small but notable portion of participants turning to hardship withdrawals. The driving force behind the rise in contributions and worker participation in retirement plans is tied to more employers automatically enrolling new employees in their retirement plans with no waiting period. More than 6 in 10 plans now do so, typically earmarking those contributions to a target-date retirement fund . (Workers can opt out if they choose.) Read more: How much can you contribute to your 401(k) in 2025? Good news on the retirement front from Vanguard. (Getty Creative) · Yevgen Romanenko via Getty Images That's roughly double the number of plans that did so a decade ago. Even better, nearly two-thirds of employer plans in this year's report set the default savings rate, or the percentage of a new contributor's paycheck shifted into the employer retirement plan, at 4% or higher. Roughly 30% of plans are setting defaults at 6% or higher — nearly double the proportion of plans choosing 6% or more in 2015. Again, workers can tweak that amount as they see fit. But for most people, inertia kicks in and they let it be. ""Automatic enrollment in 401(k) plans helps workers overcome many of the common barriers to saving for retirement — lack of planning skills, difficulty with complex financial decisions, or procrastination,"" Jeff Clark, head of defined contribution research at Vanguard, told Yahoo Finance. Among auto-enrollment plans, around 7 in 10 of Vanguard's plan participants have their contribution level automatically bumped up annually by their employer, usually by 1% to 2%, not so subtly pushing people to save more each year. Read more: 401(k) vs. IRA: The differences and how to choose which is right for you Other findings Hot Roth: Tax planning for retirement seems to be gaining steam with many workers. Eighteen percent of participants make their contributions to their 401(k) plan in a Roth option — a new high, per the data. Workers pay taxes on the amount pulled from their paycheck, but once the money is invested in the Roth, it grows tax-free and can be withdrawn tax-free in retirement. On target: Now back to those target-date funds. Americans love these funds. I do too. Target-date fund assets soared to a record $4 trillion in 2024, according to Morningstar's recent ""Target-Date Fund Landscape"" report. At Vanguard, last year more than 8 in 10 participants in its 401(k) accounts used target-date funds. About two-thirds of all 2024 contributions went into these funds — more than ever before. Roughly 7 in 10 target-date investors, in fact, had their entire account invested in a single target-date fund. That's up from 6 in 10 in 2022 and more than double those who did so in 2013. Target-date strategies are a ""set it and forget it"" way to invest savings based on a ""retirement"" year you pick — say, when you turn 67, the full retirement age for most of us. The fund shifts an account's investments, typically made up of index funds, from stocks to more fixed income and less volatile choices, such as cash and bonds, as you age. Participants who are pure target-date fund investors not only benefit from continuous rebalancing and more age-appropriate investments in equities but also are far less likely to trade when compared with all other investors, according to Vanguard's research. Clark said this has also influenced extreme portfolio allocations. The percentage of 401(k) investors with no allocation to equities has fallen to an all-time low, and the percentage of participants investing exclusively in equities has also fallen significantly, according to the research. About one-half of participants ages 25 to 34 were invested in a 2060 target-date fund in 2024, which is composed of more than 90% equity index funds and the remainder in bond index funds. Half of participants ages 55 to 64 were invested in a 2030 target-date fund with 61.8% equity index funds and the balance in bond index funds. Have a question about retirement? Personal finances? Anything career-related? Click here to drop Kerry Hannon a note. Retirement raids: One blip. While the bulk of Vanguard plan participants are piling up their account balances, an increasing number of people are pulling funds out through hardship withdrawals — 4.8% of participants tapped a hardship withdrawal, up from 3.6% in 2023, scoring another largest ever figure. Aside from dwindling retirement savings, they paid income tax on any previously untaxed money and an additional 10% tax if they were not at least 59 1/2. There are a few exceptions to the tax penalty. These include certain medical expenses, qualified tuition payments, and up to $10,000 for first-time homebuyers. In 2024, more than a third (35%) of hardship withdrawals were used to avoid a home foreclosure or eviction. The second most common reason was medical expenses, followed by withdrawals used for home repair. ""The modest increase in hardship withdrawals indicates a need for financial wellness and emergency savings resources for workers,"" Clark said. Kerry Hannon is a Senior Columnist at Yahoo Finance.

"Tesla's robotaxi launch could drive industry disruption and market share gain, analysts say",2025-06-25 22:39:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/teslas-robotaxi-launch-could-drive-industry-disruption-and-market-share-gain-analysts-say-133937404.html,"Tesla's ( TSLA ) robotaxi could reshape the auto market, Piper Sandler said. In a new note to clients, the firm reiterated its bullish stance, citing Tesla's pioneering work and first-mover advantage in self-driving software. ""Tesla is still the most transformative company in autos,"" analysts led by Alexander Potter wrote. ""Over time, Tesla will likely win."" The report also warns that as self-driving tech scales, the broader auto market is at risk of major disruption, including fewer vehicles sold, higher utilization of fleets, and a shift toward service-based revenue models. Piper Sandler said Tesla could become a consolidator and identified no other winners in the space. Tesla is not the first player in the autonomous race. Google's ( GOOG , GOOGL ) Waymo launched its driverless taxis in Phoenix in 2018 and now operates fleets in San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and Austin. Amazon's Zoox began testing on public roads in 2023. Tesla opened its robotaxi service to limited riders in Austin this Sunday. The company also has several competitors in China. Baidu ( BIDU ) launched its robotaxi fleet in 2022 and reportedly has plans to expand in Europe. Piper Sandler analysts said other US automakers are falling behind as the future of mobility evolves. GM ( GM ) and Ford ( FORD ) are still lagging on software, while Rivian ( RIVN ) faces execution risks. Stellantis ( STLA ) has the ""steepest hill to climb"" with manager turnover and geographic complexity. ""Each company has pros and cons, but none appear as well-positioned as TSLA,"" they wrote. Still, the firm is realistic about the road ahead. It said Tesla's Q2 results could disappoint and a robotaxi crash could dent the company's lofty valuation, adding that such an event ""appears inevitable."" GM's Cruise shut its robotaxis operations after one of its cars struck a pedestrian in San Francisco in 2023. Tesla's sales have been sagging as the demand for EVs slows and CEO Elon Musk's politics fueled boycotts and demonstrations worldwide. For its first quarter , Tesla's revenue of $19.34 billion and EPS of $0.27 both widely missed Wall Street expectations of $21.43 billion and $0.44, respectively. Its Q1 adjusted profits fell 40% year over year. Its vehicle delivery of 336,681 units was the worst since the second quarter of 2022. Its new car sales in Europe have fallen for five straight months in 2025, down 27.9% year over year in May. Read more: How to avoid Tesla car insurance sticker shock But Piper Sandler argues that Tesla's lead in autonomy is only growing as full self-driving (FSD) rolls out in more cities and the Trump administration potentially issues more favorable policies. The bullish take lands as Tesla stock continues a blistering rally. Shares are up 40% in June, adding more than $200 billion to the market cap. The stock is still down 10% year to date.

Novo Nordisk split puts Hims & Hers future in question,2025-06-25 22:07:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/novo-nordisk-split-puts-hims--hers-future-in-question-130721017.html,"The partnership forged by Novo Nordisk ( NVO ) and Hims & Hers ( HIMS ) in April appeared to bring together two giant brands in the growing weight-loss market. It's why the sudden fallout less than two months later stunned and stumped insiders. Hims & Hers has leaned on compounding, which accounted for 15% of revenues last year, as part of the growth story it has pitched to investors. It accused Novo Nordisk of forcing it to ""steer"" patients to branded Wegovy, while Novo Nordisk accused Hims of steering patients to unapproved compounded or ""copycat"" drugs. ""In recent weeks, Novo Nordisk's commercial team increasingly pressured us to control clinical standards and steer patients to Wegovy. We refuse to be strong-armed by any pharmaceutical company's anticompetitive demands,"" Hims & Hers CEO Andrew Dudum wrote in a post on X. ""We ... will not compromise the integrity of our platform to appease a third party or preserve a collaboration,"" he added. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) initially allowed compounded products on the market when both Eli Lilly ( LLY ) and Novo Nordisk were unable to produce enough of their GLP-1 drugs and faced shortages. However, after the shortages ended in recent months, the FDA made compounding illegal. But compounding pharmacies claim they still have a right to produce if patients cannot take the branded products due to allergies or tolerability issues, which is allowed under FDA rules as a ""personalized"" medicine. Hims & Hers declined to provide additional comment on the issue and declined an interview request. Novo Nordisk, meanwhile, told Yahoo Finance in an emailed statement that it ended the collaboration because of the compounded semaglutide, which are copycats of Wegovy based on the same key ingredient but with other additives. Hims & Hers ""has failed to adhere to the law which prohibits mass sales of compounded drugs under the false guise of 'personalization' and are disseminating deceptive marketing that put patient safety at risk,"" Novo Nordisk told Yahoo Finance in a statement. Hims & Hers continues to ask patients if they are interested in ""personalized"" treatments when they seek GLP-1s on the site, which was the basis for Novo Nordisk's pullback, according to Michael Schnell, healthcare M&A director at consultancy West Monroe. The timeline However, Novo Nordisk knew Hims & Hers would continue selling the copycats when it first announced the agreement in April, according to Dudum. ""We continue to expect the personalized semaglutide to exist on the platform. That's something we've shared as of last call, and it's something we shared earlier with Novo,"" he said on an earnings call in May. Novo Nordisk launched the partnership through CenterWell, Humana's ( HUM ) mail-order pharmacy, which would dispense the drugs prescribed by three telehealth providers — one of which was Hims & Hers. The agreement did not include any requirement for Hims & Hers to stop selling compounded semaglutide, Novo Nordisk confirmed to Yahoo Finance on Tuesday. And Hims & Hers never indicated it would stop selling the copycats. In April, Hims & Hers began to add ""branded tirzepatide"" on its platform, noting that it was ""in addition to oral medication kits, compounded semaglutide, and branded semaglutide,"" according to Craig Primack, Hims & Hers senior vice president of weight loss . Branded tirzepatide drugs are Eli Lilly's weight-loss drug Zepbound and diabetes drug Mounjaro. Hims & Hers is not part of Eli Lilly's direct-to-consumer telehealth offerings , but it can sell the injectables through the normal wholesale acquisition process as it does for other drugs. Hims & Hers CEO Dudum said on an earnings call in May that he had been in discussions to integrate with Eli Lilly's platform with no success. The move indicated a significant milestone for Hims & Hers, which began as a telehealth platform in 2017, catering to men's health with off-patent products such as hair loss and erectile dysfunction drugs. Dudum suggested this could open doors to branded pharma opportunities. ""Over time, we expect wider collaboration across the industry, from pharmaceutical players, innovative leaders in diagnostic and preventative testing to world class providers. We look forward to providing future updates as this collaboration and others like it continue to evolve,"" Dudum said.

(Reuters/Hollie Adams/Brendan McDermid/Combination/File Photo) · Reuters / Reuters Pressure on future growth Whether this spat with Novo Nordisk could damage future pharma relationships for Hims & Hers remains to be seen. Schnell said the move could indicate either that Dudum believes in staying true to the company's roots as an access point for lower-cost drugs or, despite regulatory limitations, compounded GLP-1s could still be more profitable than selling branded drugs. ""If you're him, you're trying to reach some escape velocity here. Long term, he's got to know that you cannot compound your way into being a fully mature company,"" Schnell said. Jefferies analyst Glen Santangelo wrote in an April note to clients that the move to work more with branded drugs was positive. However, he also noted that the outlook for Hims & Hers remained uncertain. ""A review of weight loss offerings on the HIMS website suggests a shift to branded GLP-1s ... with less emphasis on personal compounding. We believe this was necessary to stay out of regulatory/IP [intellectual property] crosshairs. This shift has started to weigh on web traffic. While 1Q seems fine, we highlight traffic has slowed since the Super Bowl raising questions about [forward estimates],"" Santangelo said. Requests to follow up with Santangelo were not returned. But with Hims & Hers now in a public tiff with Novo Nordisk, it remains to be seen how Hims & Hers performs. ""If he gets pushed off of compounding this way, it's very difficult for a lot of the growth projections they have,"" Schnell said.

Consumers are feeling the pressure of a stagnant labor market,2025-06-25 20:10:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/consumers-are-feeling-the-pressure-of-a-stagnant-labor-market-100011096.html,"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings Consumers are feeling worse about the labor market outlook. In June's Consumer Confidence Survey , 29.2% of respondents said jobs were ""plentiful,"" down from 31.1% in May. Meanwhile, 18.1% of consumers said jobs were ""hard to get,"" down slightly from 18.4% in month prior. These may seem like mere details, but this pushed the difference between the two — a closely watched sentiment reading called the labor market differential — to just 11.1 percentage points in June. That marked the lowest gap since March 2021, when the job market was recovering from the onset of the pandemic. Coupled with the surprise of the reading, expected to be strong, and it's something of note. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Morning Brief Subscribe By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy The current situation is different than the so-called vibecession of 2022, where consumers felt worse about the state of the economy than actual data had shown. This time, consumers aren't getting it twisted: There are clear signs of slowing in the labor market all over the place right now. Weekly filings for unemployment are hovering at an eight-month high . In a sign workers are taking longer to find jobs, continuing unemployment claims are near their highest level since November 2021. The hiring rate is near its lowest level in more than a decade . And the outlook for certain cohorts of the labor market, like tech workers and new college graduates , is worse than before the pandemic. ""The lost momentum in the labor market is not lost on consumers,"" Wells Fargo senior economist Tim Quinlan wrote in a note to clients. The weakening labor market outlook helped contribute to the broad Consumer Confidence Index unexpectedly declining in June after a large May bounce back. But perhaps even more importantly, it's also one reason why some are clamoring for the Federal Reserve to consider cutting interest rates soon. In a speech on June 23 , Federal Reserve governor Michelle Bowman noted that while the labor market is showing signs of strength, it ""appears to be less dynamic."" ""With inflation on a sustained trajectory toward 2%, softness in aggregate demand, and signs of fragility in the labor market, I think that we should put more weight on downside risks to our employment mandate going forward,"" Bowman said. But with seven officials forecasting no interest rate cuts this year and eight penciling in two cuts, there's clear debate about whether rising inflation or a weakening labor market will drive the Fed's policy decisions over the next few months. While testifying in front of House lawmakers on Tuesday, Fed Chair Powell stressed the central bank is ""well-positioned to wait"" before moving interest rates. Powell cited wider-ranging metrics like the national unemployment rate at 4.2% and an average of 124,000 nonfarm payroll gains through the first five months of the year to describe labor market conditions as ""solid."" And it's hard to argue that. But the argument for the Fed to cut sooner rather than later isn't about the broad-ranging metrics flashing warning signs. If that were the case it wouldn't be an argument. Just look back to the Fed's jumbo half percentage point interest rate cut last September that came after a string of weak labor data. Instead, the key concern some economists have about the economic outlook is being expressed by slowing on the margin and the fear those data points could be pointing to something worse. As Renaissance Macro head of economics Neil Dutta wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday, ""I follow what consumers tell me about the jobs market since they tend to lead the actual data.""

DOGE layoffs are starting to leave their mark on D.C.’s housing market,2025-06-28 22:10:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/doge-layoffs-are-starting-to-leave-their-mark-on-dcs-housing-market-090043990.html,"The DOGE effect is finally here. After months of speculation, there are growing signs that the housing market in the Washington, D.C., metro area is starting to shift, and federal workforce layoffs are to blame, according to new data from Bright MLS, the multiple listing service that serves the mid-Atlantic region. For-sale inventory in the region is spiking, driven in part by early retirements and general economic uncertainty. While prices are holding steady for now, some real estate agents are reporting buyer hesitancy that could translate to lower prices down the line. Nearly 40% of D.C.-area agents surveyed by Bright MLS said they worked with clients who were buying or selling due to federal layoffs or buyout offers last month. Over half said the job cuts were affecting the market, and 43% reported seeing more sellers. “The key word is uncertainty — total uncertainty,” said Diane Yochelson, a Realtor at Compass in Bethesda, Md., just northwest of the city. “One day you go to work, and the next day you’re done — you can’t even go back to your office.” Yochelson has had several clients in government contracting who were affected by the cuts. One, who was laid off in February, was hoping to buy a home in the region before her son started kindergarten. Now, several months later and still unemployed, she’s thinking about living elsewhere. “People are now considering leaving the D.C. area,” Yochelson said. “Even if it’s a two-income family and only one person has lost their income, because of the financial straits they’re in, they may look to go someplace else where it’s more affordable.” Read more: 2025 housing market: Is it a good time to buy a house? As of May, there were more than 13,500 homes for sale in the D.C. metro area, according to Realtor.com, nearly double the inventory available a year earlier. Listings have increased nationwide, but there’s evidence that at least some of the jump in the D.C. area is tied to the Department of Government Efficiency’s efforts to shrink the federal workforce through layoffs and buyouts, said Lisa Sturtevant, Bright MLS’s chief economist. Agents and brokers reported that some 15% of spring sellers in D.C. were selling due to retirement, compared with less than 10% in the broader mid-Atlantic region. Earlier this year, the Trump administration offered a buyout to federal workers, offering up to eight months of salary and benefits. Around 75,000 took the offer. Though federal workers are based all over the country, about 15% live in the D.C. area.

The median home in the area sold for just under $660,000 in May, up 3.1% from a year ago, according to Bright MLS data. But Sturtevant thinks prices can’t continue to grow as aggressively in the months ahead. “We’re at a point now where there’s enough inventory that’s come on the market that we are starting to see a change in prices,” she said. “We’ll continue to see prices grow more slowly and possibly actually decline year over year in some local markets.” Sign up for the Mind Your Money weekly newsletter Subscribe By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Cliff Cohen, an estate planning lawyer, knew he was taking a gamble when he decided to put his condo in Friendship Heights, Md., on the market in April with the goal of relocating to Florida.

The US government could run out of money after Aug. 15 without debt ceiling action: BPC,2025-06-25 18:00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-us-government-could-run-out-of-money-after-aug-15-without-debt-ceiling-action-bpc-090026797.html,"A new projection of Washington's looming ""X date,"" when the US government will be unable to pay its bills because of the debt ceiling cap, finds that the deadline is likely to fall between Aug. 15 and Oct. 3 unless Congress acts. The new projection from the Bipartisan Policy Center released Wednesday is one of the most detailed looks so far at when the full faith and credit of the United States could be exhausted. It's a deadline sure to be closely watched by Wall Street because of the potential dire economic costs. A breach could mean a financial crisis and an economic recession. Read more: What is the debt ceiling, and how does it impact you? Wednesday's report also underlined the difficulty in making precise predictions, listing multiple factors that could inject further uncertainty in the weeks ahead. The group also said that with billions flowing in and out of government coffers every day, it is hard to predict patterns: ""No one — not even the Treasury Secretary — can know precisely when the X date will arrive."" The updated deadline is also likely to further GOP resolve to pass Trump's ""big, beautiful bill"" as soon as possible, with Republicans committing to using the complicated mega-bill as their vehicle to stave off a default. President Donald Trump is seen at a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) summit in The Hague, on Tuesday. (JOHN THYS/AFP via Getty Images) · JOHN THYS via Getty Images President Trump even told lawmakers on Tuesday before the release not to go on vacation and ""lock yourself in a room if you must"" to get the bill passed. The recently released Senate version of the bill raises the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, compared with $4 trillion in the House version. The current debt ceiling is $36.1 trillion and was reached in January, with policymakers able to delay the X date through what are known as ""extraordinary measures."" Wednesday's Bipartisan Policy Center report found that three of those main measures — where the government can temporarily access money to pay its bills — are largely exhausted. ""Congress must address the debt limit ahead of the August recess,"" Margaret Spellings, president and CEO of the Bipartisan Policy Center, added in a statement alongside the release. ""Congress can't afford to inject any additional uncertainty into the mix,"" she said. The latest prediction is a refinement in the timing from the group's analysts after a May analysis found the day of reckoning could arrive between August and early October and a March analysis that suggested a window of mid-July to early October. This latest projection also comes as the potentially market-rattling deadline gets closer and the agency with the most insight into the issue — the Treasury Department — is offering only broad guidance. ""We don't give out a date, but I can tell you we're getting close to the warning track,"" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters on Tuesday, echoing language he offered around a letter in May where he said default would ""wreak havoc on our financial system"" and that ""there is a reasonable probability that the federal government's cash and extraordinary measures will be exhausted in August."" Bessent also added another factor for markets to consider in his Tuesday comments, noting that the X date could change due to ""the court's interfering in the president's right to set the trade agenda because we would have to refund this very substantial tariff income."" Tariff revenue topped $22 billion last month in the latest surge from customs duties. But the totals are unlikely to change the overall fiscal picture for long, with the US government spending an average of $16.9 billion per day. Read more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet Shai Akabas, the Bipartisan Policy Center's vice president of economic policy, noted that Congress faced a similar debt ceiling deadline in the summer of 2019. The ever-ballooning debt since then, he said, ""should serve as a reminder to lawmakers that the debt limit has not served as an effective tool for fiscal discipline and that the current process is in dire need of reform."" Still the debt ceiling is key issue for budget-conscious Republican lawmakers, many of whom have never voted for a debt ceiling increase and wear that fact as a badge of honor. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky is a leading Republican critic of the bill and recently told NBC he's ""not an absolute no"" on the package, but he has one main condition to get to yes: the removal of the provision to raise the debt ceiling.

Commentary: Why Trump's trade war will last way longer than his Iran war,2025-06-25 05:48:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/commentary-why-trumps-trade-war-will-last-way-longer-than-his-iran-war-204625290.html,"President Trump had a unique advantage when he ordered the June 21 US strikes against Iranian nuclear targets: giant ""bunker buster"" bombs able to penetrate deeper than any weapon short of a nuke. That allowed Trump to declare victory after a few bombing runs that barely lasted a day. In Trump's other conflict — the trade standoff with dozens of trading partners — there is no such decisive weapon. Trump pretends there is, claiming that other nations will suffer grievous harm if he raises tariffs on the goods they import to the US. But in these battles, Trump is often bluffing, and his adversaries know it. Trump's willingness to attack Iran provides lessons on how he handles risk and negotiates in challenging situations. It may also dispel a myth or two about how he's prosecuting the trade war. For one thing, Trump doesn't always ""chicken out."" The so-called TACO trade — ""Trump Always Chickens Out"" — became memey in May after a Financial Times columnist observed that Trump often postpones or backs down from tariff threats. But that isn't completely true. Trump has imposed new tariffs on imports from most countries, raising the average import tax from 2.5% before he took office to about 15% . American importers are paying those taxes , and they'll be the first to tell you that, alas, Trump hasn't chickened out. Trump certainly could have chickened out when it came to Iran, especially given that several of his White House predecessors declined to attack Iranian nuclear facilities, choosing diplomacy and negotiation instead. That was Trump's approach too, until Israel opened the door to a US strike with a week of bombing that accomplished much of the job of degrading Iran's nuclear program. Even then, Trump took a considerable risk in dropping bombs on Iran, given that it could seek revenge through attacks on Americans or efforts to disrupt oil flows and cause an energy shock. What Trump demonstrated in attacking Iran is that when he has a strong hand, he plays it. Strategist Eliot Cohen of the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies said Trump has a "" feral instinct for human weakness ... when his enemy is lying prostrate in front of him, he's perfectly happy to kick him in the head."" Drop Rick Newman a note , take his weekly economy quiz , or sign up for his newsletter . President Trump speaks with reporters on Air Force One while in flight from Joint Base Andrews, Md., to Amsterdam, Netherlands, on June 24. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) · ASSOCIATED PRESS That was the Trump who bombed Iran. Its air defense system was shredded, its leader hiding in a bunker. Trump took a risk other presidents haven't taken because he felt the odds of success were strongly in his favor — and he might have been right. In Trump's trade war, however, most adversaries aren't nearly as vulnerable. Trump has no magic weapon, and victory is elusive. This will likely become apparent once again as a July 9 deadline approaches for dozens of countries to make trade deals with Trump or risk his ""reciprocal"" tariffs. The trade war was never going to end in a day, or a month, or even a year. Trump announced draconian tariffs on April 2 but postponed them a week later after an ugly market sell-off. That was Trump showing weakness, rather than the other way around, because his tariffs amounted to friendly fire, causing unintended damage at home. Markets have yo-yoed as Trump's tariffs go on, then come off, triggering alternating bouts of despair and euphoria. But markets are generally adjusting to a tariff regime that might not be so bad because Trump doesn't have the leverage to strike a decisive and lasting blow, as he did with Iran. Read more: 5 ways to tariff-proof your finances Torsten Sløk , chief economist at private equity firm Apollo (Yahoo's parent company), recently mused that Trump may have "" outsmarted everyone on tariffs ."" He suggested that as the July 9 deadline approaches, Trump may extend his trade deal deadline by as much as a year, giving markets time to adjust while the US pulls in something like $400 billion in tariff revenue, which would be nearly a fivefold increase over 2024 levels. The bigger surprise for markets, in fact, would be if Trump attempted some kind of shock-and-awe tariff blast around the July 9 deadline, rather than simply setting a new deadline. ""The widely held assumption (which we share) appears to be that even if deals with trade partners do not materialize in the next two weeks (which is unlikely), the pause will simply be extended,"" Capital Economics explained in a June 24 analysis. ""Market turmoil on the scale of those sparked by the original tariffs back in April looks improbable, if only because market participants would probably assume that any sell-off would lead to another u-turn."" Trump's deliberations with China, as one example, suggest the whole ordeal could end up a quagmire rather than a decisive victory for one side or the other. In April, Trump hit Chinese imports with tariffs as high as 145%, which basically halted all inbound shipments. Trump lowered that to 30% in May. Some analysts described that development as a ""truce"" in the trade war and said it damaged Trump's credibility as a negotiator because he failed to act on a threat. Read more: How to protect your money during turmoil, stock market volatility Trump hasn't explained exactly what he wants from China, which could be part of a strategy that allows him to declare victory at any time and only then explain what his demands are, once he knows what he can get China to agree to. Yet China is making even that difficult. In response to Trump's tariffs, one Chinese move has been to impose new limits on exports of rare-earth magnets , a market China dominates, with about 90% of the world's supply. US companies that need those magnets for automobiles, fighter jets, medical equipment, electronics, and many other things are now running into shortages, in some cases threatening the shutdown of domestic assembly lines . As Trump sniffs out weakness in an adversary, he also recognizes strength. He must recognize that his promise of revitalizing US manufacturing will never pan out if American firms can't even get key components. China may not have all the leverage, but it certainly has some. This puts Trump in the position of bluffing, and the more he bluffs, the less serious he seems. That's why investors are fairly confident Trump's July 9 deadline will merely morph into another deadline, and maybe another one after that. The S&P 500 stock index has broadly recovered from the April sell-off, and it's close to topping the all-time high set in February. That's an indication investors don't think Trump's tariffs will harm corporate profits or stock values. There's no bunker buster in a trade war, and markets are grateful for that.

Wall Street bull calls for another 10% rally in S&P 500 by end of 2025,2025-06-25 05:06:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-bull-calls-for-another-10-rally-in-sp-500-by-end-of-2025-200633557.html,"The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) is back within one percentage point of an all-time high . One of Wall Street's notorious bulls believes the benchmark index has plenty further to run this year. BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski boosted his year-end target to 6,700 from a prior forecast of 6,100. Belski had previously reduced his forecast amid the tariff turmoil that tanked markets in April. But now, with the market's largest tariff fears believed by strategists to be behind investors, Belski detailed a more sanguine outlook in a note sent to clients on Tuesday entitled ""same as it ever was."" ""The signposts we called out in April are largely in place – markets are transitioning TO 'show me' FROM 'scare me,""' Belski wrote. ""We believe performance is broadening, reactions from daily rhetoric are calming, and actual corporate guidance will increase coming out of the 2Q earnings reporting period."" Belski's call for a roughly 10% rally for the S&P 500 from current levels joins a growing list of such predictions from rejuvenated bulls as the market marches back toward record highs. No fewer than 11 Wall Street firms lowered their S&P 500 targets amid the market sell-off in April. At least eight of those have since raised their bets on where the index will end 2025. Read more: How to protect your money during turmoil, stock market volatility Belski points out that economic forecasts have once again begun reverting higher , along with projections for corporate earnings this year. In fact, he argues, earnings estimates for Communication Services ( XLC ), Consumer Discretionary ( XLY ), Technology ( XLK ), and ""ESPECIALLY"" Financials ( XLF ) likely haven't recovered enough. Belski admitted he cut his target on April 9, prior to Trumps' first large ""reciprocal"" tariff delay , explaining that maintaining a market target that at the time was 30% above the S&P 500's current level was ""not thoughtful."" But the narrative quickly shifted with President Trump's various tariff pauses pushing the effective US tariff rate from a peak above 25% to about 14%, per the Yale Budget Lab . With that shift has come the unwind of several popular trades of the early April period, including the so-called Sell America trade , which Belski believes was overdone. ""The death of 'American Exceptionalism' was widely exaggerated and too vehemently applauded to hold any merit or duration in our view,"" Belski wrote. ""After all, we continue to believe US stocks are the best global equity asset, offering the most consistent fundamentals, ingenuity, and diversification than any other market in the world."" No fewer than 11 Wall Street firms lowered their S&P 500 targets amid the market sell-off in April, but now at least eight of those have since raised their bets on where the index will end 2025.

"Circle stock falls 15%, snapping monster rally as Wall Street flags rising risk of stablecoin competition",2025-06-25 05:06:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/circle-stock-falls-15-snapping-monster-rally-as-wall-street-flags-rising-risk-of-stablecoin-competition-200628123.html,"Circle ( CRCL ) stock fell 15% on Tuesday, retreating from a stunning rally fueled by optimism over stablecoin regulation and adoption, as Wall Street shifted its focus to the rising risk of competition in the digital token space. Shares of the issuer of the USDC stablecoin ( USDC-USD ) snapped a three-day winning streak to close just above $223. The stock soared after the Senate passed the GENIUS Act last week — legislation that would establish a federal framework for digital tokens backed by assets such as the US dollar. “In the near term, we expect CRCL to continue trading off bullish momentum around stablecoin adoption,” Compass Point analyst Ed Engel wrote in a note Tuesday. But the same regulatory clarity that lifted Circle shares is also expected to open the floodgates for new competition once the bill is finalized later this summer, Engel wrote. “We expect competition to accelerate after stablecoin legislation passes,” Engel wrote. “This influx of competition could reduce long-term market share expectations and pressure CRCL shares in 2025.” Engel and his team initiated coverage of the stock with a Neutral rating and $205 price target. Circle generates most of its revenue from ""reserve income"" — interest earned on assets backing its USDC stablecoin, a large part of which are short-term US Treasurys. The company also earns income from services such as blockchain integration, where developers pay Circle to integrate USDC into their applications, and also fees for redeeming USDC for dollars. Engel emphasized that distribution will be the key driver of market share growth going forward, especially as more regulated companies begin launching their own stablecoins. ""Circle already pays ~60% of reserve revenue to distribution partners, primarily to Coinbase but more recently Binance,"" Engel wrote. ""While Coinbase and Binance are ideal partners for capturing demand from crypto speculators, we believe USDC needs to partner with mainstream businesses to capture market share within payments."" On Monday, fintech firm Fiserv ( FI ) announced plans to launch a digital asset platform, including a new stablecoin (FIUSD) by the end of this year using existing infrastructure from issuers Paxos and Circle. ""For CRCL, we like seeing its inclusion as a leading partner of FI as FI develops its own stablecoin — this is a nice 'win' for CRCL which highlights the company's ongoing rise,"" Seaport Research Partners analyst Jeff Cantwell wrote in a note on Monday. Last week, Cantwell initiated coverage on Circle with a Buy rating and a $235 price target. Shares have soared roughly 620% from their IPO price of $31 on June 5.

The Nasdaq 100 ( NQ=F ), which tracks many of the market’s most influential tech names like Nvidia ( NVDA ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), and Apple ( AAPL ), notched a fresh closing high, underscoring renewed momentum in megacap tech. The rally came as optimism grew around a fragile US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Iran, raising hopes for a more lasting end to regional hostilities. Markets were also focused on Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s testimony to Congress , where he signaled the central bank could cut interest rates ""sooner rather than later"" while maintaining flexibility to wait and assess the inflationary impact of new tariffs. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) led the gains, rising about 1.4%, while the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) added 1.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) also rallied, jumping over 500 points, or roughly 1.2%. A relief rally has been building amid hopes for a lasting end to the 12-day-old Middle East conflict, which has spooked markets with its risks of squeezed oil supply and escalation into full-blown war. On Monday, US stocks rose as Iran's response to US attacks signaled a desire to deescalate tensions. On Tuesday, President Trump said that the pause in hostilities had begun . Meanwhile, Israel confirmed it had agreed to a truce brokered by the US and announced by Trump late on Monday. But just hours later, Israel accused Iran of breaching the ceasefire. Trump lashed out at both sides, though the fragile truce ultimately appeared to hold up for now. Oil prices continued a descent as the prospect of a lasting truce eased worries about disruption to the supply of crude, centered on the risk that Iran would block the key Strait of Hormuz conduit for tankers. Brent ( BZ=F ) and West Texas Intermediate ( CL=F ) futures both moved toward levels seen before the outbreak of the conflict. Meanwhile, Powell's testimony before the House Financial Services Committee came as Trump turns up the pressure on the Federal Reserve chair to cut interest rates. In prepared remarks, Powell reiterated his stance that the central bank can afford to hold interest rates steady for now, saying, ""For the time being, we are well-positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance.""

West Texas Intermediate ( CL=F ) fell as much 6% to trade near $65 per barrel, while Brent crude ( BZ=F ), the international benchmark, also tumbled to hover above $67 per barrel. Crude prices are now near levels back before the Israel-Iran conflict started more than a week ago. On Tuesday morning Trump wrote on social media, ""ISRAEL is not going to attack Iran. All planes will turn around and head home, while doing a friendly “Plane Wave” to Iran. Nobody will be hurt, the Ceasefire is in effect!"" Earlier on Tuesday morning, Trump urged Israel to stop its strikes on Iran after Tel Aviv accused Tehran of breaching the truce that had gone into effect just hours earlier.

Nvidia notched a record closing price of $149.41 on Jan. 6, but the AI chipmaker’s shares have struggled in the months following that high as Trump’s trade war and AI competition in China rattled the markets. Nvidia has risen more than 12% in the past month alone, roughly double the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite’s ( ^IXIC ) 6.3% gain. Chip stocks rallied across the board Tuesday. Intel ( INTC ) climbed 6.5%, AMD ( AMD ) climbed 6.2%, and Broadcom ( AVGO ) rose 3.2%. US-listed shares of Nvidia’s Taiwan-based contract manufacturer TSMC ( TSM ) soared 4.3%. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq 100 ( NQ=F ) was set to hit a fresh record close Tuesday, trading above 22,400. The index hit its last record close of 22,175.60 on Feb. 19.

Alphabet stock was up nearly 2%. Uber and Waymo have partnered to offer robotaxi rides in Phoenix and Austin, as well. Waymo last week applied for a permit to test its self-driving cabs in New York City. ""UBER would be a natural strategic partner for Waymo in NYC,"" Jefferies analyst John Colantuoni wrote in a note to clients on June 20. Uber and Alphabet's gains come as Tesla ( TSLA ) stock fell after incidents involving its own robotaxis caught the attention of regulators. Also last week, Uber unveiled a new AI platform , which offers its data to help train AI models for other companies. RBC Capital Markets analyst Brad Erickson said the move was""somewhat eyebrow raising for how outside of the core business it might seem but there's certainly good logic for UBER leveraging the combo of highly unique datasets for model training.""

The gains came as tech stocks outperformed the broader market on Tuesday. The Technology Sector ( XLK ) rose 1.6%, ahead of the S&P 500's ( ^GSPC ) roughly 1% climb. The sector climbed 3% over the past 10 trading sessions, while the broader index is up 1.3%.

Tue, June 24, 2025 at 3:14 PM UTC Allie Canal Powell reiterates Fed independence amid Trump criticism In remarks made on Capitol Hill early Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell brushed aside political criticism and reaffirmed the Fed’s commitment to its mission: delivering a strong and stable economy for the American people. When asked about recent name-calling and public pressure from political leaders, including accusations from President Trump of being ""too late"" on rate cuts , Powell made it clear that such distractions don’t influence the Fed’s work. ""We’re focused on one thing,"" Powell said at the start of his two-day testimony. ""And that is we want to deliver a good economy for the benefit of the American people. That’s it. Anything else is kind of a distraction."" Powell didn’t reference any specific criticism or comments but underscored his approach to the job, saying, ""We always do what we think is the right thing to do. And, you know, we live with the consequences. I don’t know how else to do the job."" Pressed again on whether the American people should be concerned about political attacks swaying the Fed’s independence, Powell added, ""I care about doing the job for the American people. The things we do matter a lot for people’s lives, and that really concentrates the mind."" ""You want to just stay focused on that task as long as you’re sitting in these chairs that we occupy. Focus on that task. Do what you think is the right thing and take the consequences."" 'Well-positioned to wait' Earlier in his testimony, Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank can afford to hold interest rates steady for now. In prepared remarks to the House Financial Services Committee, he said, ""For the time being, we are well-positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance."" Beyond addressing political pressure, Powell also spoke to broader economic challenges facing the Fed, including the impact of tariffs and rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. On inflation, he acknowledged the potential effects of trade: ""At this time all forecasters are expecting pretty soon that that some significant inflation will show up from tariffs"" Powell said , referencing the Fed’s latest projections of higher inflation and slower economic growth compared to March's forecast. As for the conflict between Israel and Iran, Powell urged caution: ""It's too early to know what any economic implications might be. I would not want to speculate. Like everyone else, we are, of course, watching the situation.""

West Texas Intermediate ( CL=F ) fell over 6% to trade near $64.37 per barrel. Brent crude ( BZ=F ), the international benchmark, also tumbled to hover above $67.14 per barrel. Crude futures took a leg lower after Trump wrote on social media : ""China can now continue to purchase Oil from Iran. Hopefully, they will be purchasing plenty from the U.S., also. It was my Great Honor to make this happen!” The comment was seen as a reversal of his stance in May, when the President threatened ""secondary sanctions"" against importers of Iranian oil. Earlier Tuesday, Trump sought to hold both nations to the ceasefire timeline he unveiled Monday evening. ""ISRAEL is not going to attack Iran. All planes will turn around and head home, while doing a friendly “Plane Wave” to Iran. Nobody will be hurt, the Ceasefire is in effect!"" Trump wrote. Oil settled 7% lower on Monday after Iran launched missile attacks on a US air base in Qatar, retaliating against Washington's strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites over the weekend. Prices further weakened after Trump hinted Iran's retaliation had been telegraphed, thanking Tehran for ""giving us early notice."" ""Iran's response appears to have been more symbolic than escalatory — targeting US military bases but avoiding any loss of life or damage to energy structure,"" Rebecca Babin, senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth, told Yahoo Finance on Monday afternoon. Prior to the retaliatory move, Wall Street weighed various scenarios in the wake of the initial US strikes, including the threat of Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz, a critical chokepoint for roughly 20% of the world's oil flows. JPMorgan analysts projected the closure would be a ""severe outcome"" scenario, in which oil futures could spike to $120 to $130. ""Yet, beyond the short-term spike induced by geopolitics, our base case for oil remains anchored by our supply-demand balance, which shows that the world has enough oil,"" Natasha Kaneva wrote on Monday morning. JPMorgan expects oil to trade in the low-to-mid-$60 range for the remainder of 2025, assuming the Middle East risk premium fully dissipates.

How decades of oil drilling expansion helped shield Trump's US amid Iranian hostilities,2025-06-25 03:15:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-decades-of-oil-drilling-expansion-helped-shield-trumps-us-amid-iranian-hostilities-181521740.html,"President Trump is keenly interested in ensuring Middle East hostilities don't jack up prices at the pump. But oil markets have been remarkably unfazed by tensions around the Strait of Hormuz and the overall violence. That resilience, which is pronounced in the US but limited by the global nature of energy markets, is in response to an array of factors. They even include something Trump would be loath to admit: production gains overseen by Democratic Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden. Indeed, data on the US field production of crude oil compiled by the government's Energy Information Administration shows that US production has been on the rise for decades, covering Trump's first term as well as the Democratic administrations that preceded and succeeded him. The rise has been stark. The US produced just over 159 million barrels in January 2009, when Obama took office. In March of this year, that production figure stood at over 418 million barrels. And the ascent was largely fueled by the explosive growth in fracking that took hold in the mid-2000s and was helped along by presidents of both parties. Global oil prices continued to sink Tuesday after Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, before then lashing out Tuesday morning at both countries for attacks that put the truce at risk. Oil prices were also on Trump's mind Tuesday aboard Air Force One as the president headed to a NATO summit in the Netherlands. ""We're drilling like we've never drilled before,"" Trump told reporters, adding of prices, ""We're gonna keep it down until all these wars are settled."" 2 decades of energy gains Overall, Trump is right that the explosion of US production has given the US additional leverage and provided a clear backstop to the American economy. The US is now a net exporter of oil, and much of what passes through the Strait of Hormuz is bound for Asia, especially Iranian oil, which predominantly goes to China. ""China can now continue to purchase Oil from Iran,"" Trump even jabbed on Tuesday on social media as tensions eased. ""Hopefully, they will be purchasing plenty from the U.S.,"" he added. That change is due to roughly two decades of US oil production gains driven in part by the explosion in recent decades of fracking, short for hydraulic fracturing, which is a drilling technique that produces both oil and natural gas. President Trump speaks with reporters on Tuesday before traveling to the Hague to join world leaders gathering in the Netherlands for a two-day NATO summit. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) · ASSOCIATED PRESS The growth has now been nurtured by a succession of presidents despite Trump's regular claims that Biden ""crushed"" the industry. Under Biden, the US reached new heights in oil production , which proved to be an inconvenient detail for both Trump and the often green energy-focused Biden. By some measures, Biden's granting of oil drilling permits even outpaced Trump's first term. Biden also expanded limits on new drilling in the Alaskan wilderness. The change has spanned administrations, even as the fossil fuel sector itself has repeatedly expressed its preference for Trump, often citing Biden-era regulations as holding back company efforts, as well as other actions like a 2024 pause on approvals for applications to export liquefied natural gas (LNG). ""Forty, 20, or even 15 years ago, the consequences of such a global oil price shock were simple,"" American Action Forum president Douglas Holtz-Eakin pointed out in a recent note. But now, he added, pointing to the fracking revolution, ""the United States has become far less sensitive."" Eakin also pointed to recent academic work that suggests the US economy could be further buffeted by the growth of energy workers in the US. In short, these workers would gain economically if prices rise modestly and at least partially offset the increased costs for consumers. The US ""economy is better able to produce oil when oil prices rise, making high oil prices less deleterious to aggregate economic activity,"" wrote the paper's authors, Todd Potts and David Yerger of the Indiana University of Pennsylvania. But there are clear limits to how the US could be protected, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell offering some words of caution Tuesday as he testified to Congress. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testifies during a House Financial Services Committee hearing on June 24. (Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images) · SAUL LOEB via Getty Images After being asked if the US is insulated from oil shocks, Powell noted that in recent years, ""the thought was we had a natural shock absorber. We would just drill more and not have sustained oil shocks."" ""That is actually in question now,"" he added, because oil companies are ""becoming much more careful having been burned by overcapacity."" Either way, Trump's position on the energy issue is clear, with other recent oil-focused missives from the president pressuring oil companies to keep prices low , as well as one calling for more US drilling . ""To The Department of Energy: DRILL, BABY, DRILL!!! And I mean NOW!!!"" he wrote on Monday. Ben Werschkul is a Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.

Tesla Robotaxi incidents eyed by regulators as Waymo opens up service in Atlanta,2025-06-25 00:48:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-robotaxi-incidents-eyed-by-regulators-as-waymo-opens-up-service-in-atlanta-154814761.html,"The start of Tesla’s ( TSLA ) Robotaxi test apparently didn't go as smoothly as the company touted. Meanwhile, rival Waymo is expanding into another US city. In several videos posted to X.com , Tesla Robotaxis appear to violate local traffic laws by driving above posted speed limits, swerving across lanes, and hesitating to turn. In one instance, a rider named Rob Maurer posted a video in which a Tesla Robotaxi enters a left-turn-only lane, then proceeds to go straight through the intersection and cross a double yellow line the process, committing two traffic violations in the process. Tesla stock was down 2% in early trade. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has taken notice. “NHTSA is aware of the referenced incidents and is in contact with the manufacturer to gather additional information,” a spokesperson said to Yahoo Finance. “Under US law, NHTSA does not pre-approve new technologies or vehicle systems — rather, manufacturers certify that each vehicle meets NHTSA’s rigorous safety standards, and the agency investigates incidents involving potential safety defects.” NHTSA said following an assessment of the incidents, it will take any necessary action to protect road safety, adding that its investigation into Tesla’s FSD-Supervised/Beta software remains open. FILE PHOTO: A Tesla robotaxi drives on the street along South Congress Avenue in Austin, Texas, U.S., June 22, 2025. REUTERS/Joel Angel Juarez/File Photo · REUTERS / Reuters Tesla is operating its limited test in Austin, Texas, with select users able to summon Tesla Model Y robotaxis, of which 10-20 seem to be in operation. Bloomberg News was first to report on Tesla’s Robotaxi infractions. Alphabet’s ( GOOG , GOOGL ) Waymo, considered the leader in the robotaxi space with 250,000 robotaxi trips completed each week with no safety driver, has officially opened for business in Atlanta. Via Uber ( UBER ), Waymo allows users to summon its robotaxis for driverless rides. Uber said in a post that riders will be able to travel across 65 square miles of Atlanta, with plans to expand in the future. “Riders who request an UberX, Comfort, or Comfort Electric could be matched with a Waymo fully autonomous all-electric Jaguar I-PACE vehicle — at no additional cost. Before a nearby Waymo vehicle is sent your way, you’ll always have the option to accept or switch to a non-AV ride,” Uber said in a statement. In addition to Waymo's Uber partnership in Atlanta, the companies continue to offer robotaxi rides in Austin. Waymo offers its robotaxi services through its own app in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Phoenix and will also be adding New York City to the list via a supervised test soon. Tesla hasn’t revealed its next steps or when the general public will be allowed to summon a Robotaxi in Austin. Musk has said he expects “millions” of robotaxis to be driving around by the second half of 2026, but the CEO has a history of making highly speculative predictions that have not come to fruition. Waymo is on a roll and Tesla needs to get moving, with limited hiccups, if it's going to catch Waymo’s lead. Pras Subramanian is the lead auto reporter for Yahoo Finance.

T-Mobile CEO pushes back on report he would leave the role early,2025-06-25 00:43:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/t-mobile-ceo-pushes-back-on-report-he-would-leave-the-role-early-154310053.html,"T-Mobile ( TMUS ) CEO Mike Sievert says he isn't going anywhere yet. German news publication Handelsblatt reported earlier this month that Sievert, who also sits on the board of coffee giant Starbucks ( SBUX ), was eyeing an exit before his contract is up in April 2028. ""Well, I haven't made any decisions about that, and I hope that's the case,"" Sievert told Yahoo Finance when asked if he would still be leading the telecom behemoth a year from now (video above). T-Mobile recently appointed telecom industry veteran Srini Gopalan as COO, fueling speculation on Sievert's timeline as CEO. Gopalan had been a member of T-Mobile's board for four years. Sievert added, ""We did recruit Srini with the idea of succession planning in mind, and I would tell you that any business should be thinking about these things. That's not bad news. That's good news. You know, every big move I make in the people arena is about making sure that the secret sauce of this company is here for the long run and will outlive any of us."" However, the hire doesn't reflect any decision by Sievert about stepping away, he added. Sievert took over as CEO from the highly energetic T-Mobile frontman John Legere in April 2020. He has led not only the successful integration of Sprint, which T-Mobile purchased for $23 billion in 2020, but also a reinvention of the business and a steady stream of better-than-expected quarters. T-Mobile spent $1.35 billion to acquire Ryan Reynolds' Mint Mobile in May 2024, giving the company access to more value-conscious phone plan shoppers. The company has also closed deals for fiber-optic plays Metronet ($4.9 billion), US Cellular ($4.4 billion), and Lumos ($950 million). It said late Monday it would begin its service with Elon Musk's Starlink satellite business on July 23, helping to close dead zones for cell service in the country. Shares of T-Mobile are up about 176% under Sievert's watch, compared to a 25% gain for AT&T. Verizon is down by 19% during that same timespan.

Consumer confidence unexpectedly declines in June,2025-06-25 00:45:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/consumer-confidence-unexpectedly-declines-in-june-152019889.html,"Consumer confidence retreated in June after increasing the previous month amid President Trump's various tariff delays. The latest index reading from the Conference Board was 93 in June, below the 98.4 seen in May and the 99.8 economists had expected. The expectations index decreased to 69 in June from 73.6 in May when it saw its largest one-month increase since 2009. ""Tariffs remained on top of consumers’ minds and were frequently associated with concerns about their negative impacts on the economy and prices,"" Stephanie Guichard, senior economist of global indicators at the Conference Board, said in a press release. ""Inflation and high prices were another important concern cited by consumers in June."" While the effective US tariff rate has come down significantly from its peak above 25% in early April, it remains significantly higher than where the year started. The Yale Budget Lab estimates the effective US tariff rate is currently 14.7%, the highest level since 1938. The cutoff date for the preliminary survey was June 18, which means some consumers could have considered the recent conflict between Iran and Israel in their responses. But Guichard noted this wasn't a top of mind concern for respondents as mentions of geopolitics and social unrest ""remained much lower on the list of topics affecting consumers’ views."" Consumer confidence retreated in June as the highest tariffs in more than 80 years remained a top concern for Americans. (Photo by James Williamson - AMA/Getty Images) · James Williamson - AMA via Getty Images In June, 29.2% of respondents said jobs were ""plentiful,"" down from 31.1% in May. Meanwhile, 18.1% of consumers said jobs were ""hard to get,"" down slightly from 18.4% in month prior. This pushed the difference between the two — a closely watched sentiment reading called the labor market differential — to just 11.1 percentage points in June. That marked the lowest gap since March 2021 when the job market was recovering from the pandemic. The declines come as job openings have fallen from the start of 2025 while weekly filings for unemployment claims are hovering near their highest level in eight months. ""Consumers were more pessimistic about business conditions and job availability over the next six months, and optimism about future income prospects eroded slightly,"" Guichard said.

"Tesla stock valuation looks 'insane,' strategist warns",2025-06-24 21:48:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-valuation-looks-insane-strategist-warns-124835299.html,"Tesla's ( TSLA ) hyped robotaxi debut this past weekend is shedding light on one of the biggest issues facing the stock's bulls. The stock's valuation may already reflect thousands of driverless Teslas in the US collecting under $10 a trip. ""There's a lot of jazz hands going on here [with Tesla's robotaxi launch],"" Washington Crossing Advisors senior portfolio manager Chad Morganlander said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid (watch above). ""This stock trades at ten times revenue. You have a [stock] multiple that's insane."" Washington Crossing Advisors is wholly owned by boutique investment bank Stifel ( SF ). It has about $2 billion in assets under management. Morganlander said he personally owns tech giant Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ), which operates the more established Waymo autonomous taxi service. Waymo first launched its driverless taxis in Phoenix in 2018. ""Waymo has been proven, and it's working in many cities,"" Morganlander explained. ""And we believe that this whole robotaxi idea that you're going to let your car go out in the middle of the night and pick up drunk people just to make money is perhaps a little bit foolhardy.

Powell tells Congress Fed can 'wait' on rate cuts as Trump pressure intensifies,2025-06-25 00:18:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/powell-tells-congress-fed-can-wait-on-rate-cuts-as-trump-pressure-intensifies-123003878.html,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told House lawmakers today that the central bank is ""well-positioned to wait"" on any interest rate adjustments until it has more clarity on how President Trump's tariffs will affect inflation and the direction of the US economy. The reinforcement of Powell's wait-and-see strategy comes as he faces intensifying pressure for rate cuts from the White House and even some of his fellow central bank policymakers . ""Increases in tariffs this year are likely to push up prices and weigh on economic activity,"" Powell said during his semiannual testimony Tuesday before the House Committee on Financial Services. ""The effects on inflation could be short-lived — reflecting a one-time shift in the price level. It is also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent,"" he added, repeating the caution he emphasized last week after the central bank kept monetary policy unchanged for the fourth consecutive meeting. The Fed is ""well-positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance."" Powell acknowledged under questioning from GOP Rep. French Hill, chair of the House committee, that ""many paths are possible"" on rates, including ""cutting sooner"" if inflation does not heat up as expected or the labor market weakens. Read more: How the Fed rate decision affects your bank accounts, loans, credit cards, and investments But when asked by another lawmaker whether two rates are still on the table this year — the median estimate of his central bank colleagues — Powell said that ""what will happen with rates is dependent on the economy and that is highly uncertain."" Powell's guarded approach is inflaming tensions with Trump, who continues to hammer the chairman and the central bank to cut rates. The president's attacks intensified at the end of last week as Trump called for rates to drop from 4.25% to 4.5% to between 1% and 2% and said of Powell and the Fed's board of governors: ""I don't know why the Board doesn’t override this Total and Complete Moron!"" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testifies before the House Committee on Financial Services in February. (Alex Wong/Getty Images) · Alex Wong via Getty Images Trump repeated some of those points in a Tuesday social media post at 1:32 a.m. ET, calling for rates ""at least two to three points lower"" and saying that Powell ""will be in Congress today in order to explain, among other things, why he is refusing to lower the Rate."" ""I hope Congress really works this very dumb, hardheaded person, over. We will be paying for his incompetence for many years to come."" Trump is not the only one calling for lower rates. Even some of Powell's fellow policymakers — Fed governors Michelle Bowman and Chris Waller — have said in recent days that they now see cutting rates as soon as the Fed's next policy meeting in July due to recent mild inflation readings. Bowman made the argument for such a move in a speech Monday, saying that inflation has declined or come in below expectations over the past several months and asserting that trade policy will only amount to ""minimal impacts"" on the Fed's preferred inflation measure. She also cited concerns that downside risks to employment could ""soon become more salient, given recent softness in spending and signs of fragility in the labor market."" Powell on Tuesday didn't rule out a cut in July but noted that inflation figures from both June and July would be important data to consider, which might imply that a September cut could be in play if inflation remains tame. ""We are in a difficult situation in deciding when exactly to move,"" he said. The recent comments from Bowman and Waller are not the only sign of an increasing divide within the Fed. There was also a difference of opinion evident last week in the Fed's latest ""dot plot"" outlining future interest rate moves. While eight officials saw two cuts still happening in 2025, seven officials predicted no cuts at all, up from the four officials who made that call previously. Read more: The Fed's dot plot explained and why it's important Cleveland Fed president Beth Hammack added to that debate Tuesday, saying in a speech that ""I don’t see a weakening in the economy that would merit imminent rate cuts"" and that ""It may well be the case that policy remains on hold for quite some time."" Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic also told Reuters that ""I think we have some space and time"" on any cuts due to expected price increases from tariffs, predicting a single reduction late in 2025. Powell has consistently brushed off any criticism from the president, saying it doesn't interfere with his job and that he plans to serve out his full chairmanship term, slated to end in May 2026. When asked Tuesday about Trump's insults, Powell said, ""We are focused on one thing: We want to deliver a good economy for the benefit of the American people. Anything else is kind of a distraction."" ""I don't know how else to do the job,"" he added. When asked by one lawmaker how Trump's strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites affect the path forward, Powell said, ""It's too early to know what the economic implications might be."" On Monday evening, Trump said Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire that he said could lead to the end of the war between the countries. President Trump boards Air Force One last Saturday. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) · ASSOCIATED PRESS Some Fed watchers worry that any sustained increase in oil prices would add to the inflationary impulse already present in the US from Trump's tariffs. Wall Street analysts at JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ) have warned that a prolonged conflict and the potential closure of the critical Strait of Hormuz could drive oil prices as high as $120 a barrel, pushing US inflation back toward 5%. That could bolster the argument of some hawks at the Fed that rates need to stay where they are for longer to protect against another inflation surge. On the other hand, there is also an argument circulating on Wall Street that any new conflict in the Middle East could push the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates sooner than expected. Trump said on Friday that if Powell is concerned about inflation or anything else, then ""all he has to do is bring the rate down, so we can benefit on interest costs, and raise it in the future when and if these 'other elements' happen."" He also mused once more about removing Powell before his term as chair ends next May, an option he previously said he had rejected. ""Maybe, just maybe, I'll have to change my mind about firing him?"" Trump posted. ""But regardless, his Term ends shortly!"" Trump has also mused about appointing himself Fed chair. One lawmaker asked Powell on Tuesday if that was even possible. ""I don’t know,"" he said, adding that it's ""not a question for me.""

Wall Street has a short memory for global crises,2025-06-24 19:53:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-has-a-short-memory-for-global-crises-100015103.html,"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings Rising tensions in the Middle East haven't shaken the stock market yet. Since Israel's missile strike on Iran on June 13, the S&P 500 is essentially flat. This includes a 1.0% rise on Monday in the immediate reaction to the US strikes on Iran from June 21 and Iran's subsequent retaliation. Futures tied to the major US stock indexes pointed higher on Tuesday too , amid hopes that a US- brokered ceasefire between Israel and Iran could lay the groundwork for a more permanent end to hostilities. Largely, strategists have argued that as long as their response doesn't imminently threaten to significantly spike oil prices, large pain in stocks isn't expected. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Morning Brief Subscribe By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy But even if there is eventually some downside action for stocks, history says it likely wouldn't be long-lasting. In a note to clients on Monday morning, Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson analyzed more than 20 geopolitical shocks that have hit markets since 1950. On average, the S&P 500 was up 2% the month after geopolitical tensions spooked markets, 3% over the next three months, and 9% over the next 12 months, per Wilson's work. ""History suggests most geopolitically-led sell-offs are short-lived/modest,"" Wilson wrote. ""Oil prices will determine whether volatility persists."" As they say, past performance is no indicator of future results. And there are clear risks to consider amid the current conflict, first and foremost, how a large spike in oil prices could potentially boost inflation and weigh on both business and consumer spending. There's also a concern that angst over further escalation could hurt investor and consumer sentiment, which had finally started to rebound from their April lows. Both of these concerns meet a market that's already near record highs, with many stocks already richly valued, adding to the unsettling nature of the conflict for investors. But typically, WTI crude oil prices would have to rise at least 75% compared to the prior year to have a significant negative impact on stocks, per Wilson's work. In the current scenario, this would require oil to hit about $120 a barrel, a far cry from WTI's sub-$71 level seen on Monday. The key way many strategists have reasoned that oil could see such a spike would be driven by Iran closing the Straight of Hormuz, where 20% of the world's oil supply passes through. But after some reports that Iran's counterattack could be a sign of peak escalation in the conflict, odds of a Straight of Hormuz closure by the end of July hit 11% on Monday, well off the recent high of 52% seen on Sunday, on online betting platform Polymarket. And this is why the market often quickly moves on. It's a forward-looking instrument. There may be more concerning headlines coming from the Middle East over the next few days or weeks. But the market believes the worst of the headlines is over. “Often, geopolitical conflict has little to no effect on the US economy,” Ritholtz Wealth Management chief markets strategist Callie Cox wrote in a research note on Monday. ""And if markets follow the economy and earnings over time, then it’s fair to say that war rarely has any long-lasting effects on the stock market.""

Commentary: Oil isn’t the economic weapon it used to be,2025-06-24 08:07:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/commentary-oil-isnt-the-economic-weapon-it-used-to-be-230718895.html,"Anybody who’s old enough, or reads a little history, knows that the Arab oil shocks of the 1970s caused a lot of trouble. Gasoline and energy prices soared, shortages forced rationing, and America suddenly seemed vulnerable to the whims of oil sheikhs half a world away. That sense of vulnerability persists. But maybe it shouldn’t. Oil shortages can still cause painful price spikes and other problems. But the US economy is now more durable, with much better defenses against the use of oil as an economic and political weapon. Markets are grappling now with the right way to price the risk of a fresh oil shock to the US economy as Iran retaliates against joint US-Israeli attacks on its nuclear weapons program and a new Middle East war escalates. The shooting started with a June 13 Israeli blitz on Iranian nuclear facilities and other targets. On June 21, President Trump ordered US strikes with giant “bunker buster” bombs to destroy deeply buried nuclear sites that Israel lacks the firepower to reach. Iran has been lobbing missiles at Israel since June 13, and on June 23, it fired missiles at US bases in Qatar and Iraq. The damage from those attacks appears to be limited. But Trump may feel obligated to fire back, and a widening war raises the stakes of economic blowback. The biggest risk for markets is a disruption of Persian Gulf oil supplies, which could happen if Iran tries to block the Strait of Hormuz or destroy oil infrastructure in neighboring countries. Israel or the United States could also attack Iranian oil facilities, which would probably lead Iran to respond in kind. Or vice versa. About 20% of the world’s oil leaves the Persian Gulf by ship, so any disruption would have an immediate effect on global supplies. The risk of a disruption pushed oil prices up modestly after the June 13 Israeli attack. Yet prices fell after the US upped the ante with the June 21 attack, and even as Iran retaliated against US bases on June 23. Traders are betting that Iran won’t go as far as trying to block Persian Gulf oil flows, because that would interfere with Iran’s own oil shipments. But the muted trading action also reflects the fact that global oil markets are increasingly diverse, with the United States in particular far less dependent on concentrated sources of foreign energy. At the time of the 1973 Arab oil embargo , the United States was the world’s largest oil producer. But total production had peaked in 1970, and US output as a portion of the global total had been declining for more than 25 years. OPEC (Organization of Oil Exporting Countries) members, including Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, and Kuwait, collectively produced more, and they used that market power to impose an embargo on the United States and a few other countries in response to support of Israel during the Yom Kippur War. That embargo lasted for five months, causing a fourfold increase in oil prices and a roughly 40% increase in gas prices. Even though the embargo ended in 1974, high energy costs contributed to skyrocketing inflation that year. There was another oil shock in 1979, after the Iranian revolution generated turmoil that disrupted petroleum flows. Oil prices doubled, once again contributing to soaring inflation. These oil shocks also helped trigger recessions that began in November 1973 and January 1980. Tankers are seen at the Khor Fakkan Container Terminal, the only natural deep-sea port in the region and one of the major container ports in the Sharjah Emirate, along the Strait of Hormuz, a waterway through which one-fifth of global oil output passes on June 23, 2025. (Photo by Giuseppe CACACE / AFP) (Photo by GIUSEPPE CACACE/AFP via Getty Images) · GIUSEPPE CACACE via Getty Images Drop Rick Newman a note , take his weekly economy quiz , or sign up for his newsletter . Things are different now. US oil production declined from 1970 to 2008, when the United States was the third-largest oil producer, well behind Saudi Arabia and Russia. But the hydraulic fracturing boom of the last 15 years has since made the United States the No. 1 oil producer once again, by a wide margin. ""Forty years ago, the consequences of a global oil price shock were simple,"" Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum and former director of the Congressional Budget Office, wrote on June 23. ""The United States, a large net importer of oil, would face a cost shock on oil inputs into all sorts of production, putting large upward pressure on prices. With the fracking revolution, however, the United States has become far less sensitive to oil price shocks."" The United States became a net oil exporter for the first time in 2019 , exporting more than it imports. Of the oil the United States does import, 52% comes from Canada and 11% from Mexico. Only 16% of America’s imported oil comes from OPEC countries, and only 10% of it comes from the Persian Gulf countries that could be threatened if the Israel-Iran war blows up. About 80% of Persian Gulf oil goes to Asia, with much of the rest going to Europe. Oil is a global market, which means a shortage anywhere pushes prices up everywhere. But American producers now have more capacity for boosting production in a crisis, especially since America’s for-profit drilling companies would have an economic incentive to do so. The United States also has a stronger alliance with Saudi Arabia than it did during the 1970s, which is important because Saudi Arabia is probably the top “swing producer” able to ramp up oil output quickly — at government direction — if need be. While producing more oil, America also needs less of it. Total US energy consumption peaked in 2007 and has dropped slightly, even though the US population has increased and the economy has grown. On a per-capita basis, US energy consumption peaked in 1980 and is now about 21% lower . The “energy intensity” of the US economy, or total energy consumption relative to the size of GDP, has dropped consistently since 1970, and is now 67% lower than it was then. Those gains have come from many kinds of technological improvements in home building, factory design, transportation, and so on. Here’s one car owners can relate to: The average fuel efficiency of a passenger car was 14 miles per gallon (mpg) in the mid-1970s. Now, it’s about 25 mpg. Much of that improvement came as the US government raised efficiency requirements to reduce US dependence on foreign energy after the oil shocks of the 1970s. Oil also powers less of the US economy these days. In 1975, petroleum accounted for 47% of the energy consumed in the United States. Today it’s 38%. Renewables have gone from 3.6% of energy consumption to 8.8% during the same time, while nuclear has gone from 2.7% to 8.7%. The biggest shift in energy use has been the decline of coal and the rise of gas, which is good for US energy security because the United States has gobs of gas. The gas boom has led to a longstanding drop in the portion of US homes heated by oil, which was one of the biggest vulnerabilities in the 1970s. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 showed that oil still matters. Prices jumped from about $75 per barrel at the start of that year to $122 a few months after the invasion, and they stayed elevated for a year. That occurred as the United States and other Ukraine allies were hammering Russia with sanctions and boycotting its oil products. Oil flows went in new directions as Russia lost some oil customers and had to find new ones, with the chaos creating a substantial ""fear premium"" pushing prices up. Gas prices in the United States at the time hit $5 per gallon, the highest levels ever, not including inflation. But there was no recession. Energy remained widely available, American drillers produced more, and by the middle of 2023 US oil production hit a new all-time high . There’s more where that came from, which gives the United States a potent shield against any modern adversary trying to weaponize oil. Rick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance .

How to protect your money if Middle East conflict has you worried,2025-06-24 21:19:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-to-protect-your-money-if-middle-east-conflict-has-you-worried-224736769.html,"As the situation in the Middle East continues to evolve, most everyday investors and savers are, of course, edgy. Sure, the market roared back on Monday. And Iran and Israel have agreed to a ceasefire, President Trump announced Monday. That, of course, is up for debate and will play out in the hours and days to come, but ceasefire or no ceasefire, everything for normal investors still seems unsettled. Everyday folks, especially those approaching retirement, are unnerved. There is a feeling that we are always waiting for the other shoe to drop. And that's a reminder to older investors that you better balance your portfolio so that you can sleep at night without the gnawing fear that a stock market retreat will wipe out your financial ballast. Are things any different now compared with other market turbulence? Should we simply stay the course as we have always been told during volatility? Or is this moment somehow different, demanding a deeper review of our portfolios? To get a sense of all of that, I asked several personal financial experts for their best advice on how people should manage their money right now. The basic message: Don’t run scared, keep a long-view perspective, have some cash on hand for comfort to ride it out — and remember to review your accounts periodically to make sure they still line up with your time horizon, risk tolerance, and your financial goals. One thing everyone agreed on: Market timing is a fool's game. So don’t dream that you can duck out when markets swoon and sidle back in when the sun comes out again. There's a small window to get back in and hit the updraft correctly. That said, here's what our experts, and I, had to say: Surviving the decade First up, author and blogger JL Collins who has a new edition of his million-plus-selling book “The Simple Path to Wealth: Your Road Map to Financial Independence and a Rich, Free Life .” “This has been a wild decade so far,” Collins told Yahoo Finance. “We're halfway through … and we've gone through a pandemic and meme stocks and 9% inflation and interest rates going from zero to 5% in record time. Then we had these tariffs, and now what's going on in the Middle East, and yet the average annual return for S&P 500 (from January 2020 to May 2025) has been nearly 13%. That's incredible with all of that turmoil.” Rescue workers and Israeli soldiers work at the site of a direct missile strike launched from Iran in Tel Aviv, Israel, on Sunday, June 22. (AP Photo/Oded Balilty) · ASSOCIATED PRESS For now, the Middle East situation doesn't feel different when it comes to our long view on staying invested, he said. But short of a major conflict, his advice doesn’t change. If you’re nearing retirement, of course, or in retirement, you should already be shifting to more conservative investing, and that means a larger allocation to bonds, he said. “But you never want to go below 50% in stocks because you need at least 50% in stocks as the growth engine that keeps your portfolio healthy over the years and decades.” Doing nothing doesn't feel good Next up: Diane Harris, deputy editor of ""Kiplinger"" and former editor in chief of ""Money Magazine."" She has a slightly different take. “This situation has the potential to be substantively different,” Harris told Yahoo Finance. “It's different from tariffs. It's different from other bumps in the road.” That said, you can't control it. “All we can do as savers and investors and consumers is to control what we can control. And we can't control the economy. We can't control whether or not there's a war. We can't control on-again, off-again tariffs. But we can control a response in what we're doing.” It’s key to understand that what happens on any single day, or week or month, or even a year over the course of a career and through your retirement, which you're talking about 20-, 30-, 40-year time horizons, is not really going to make a difference, Harris said. “What feels like you're headed off a cliff will feel like a speed bump when you look back on it,” she added. “Keep in mind that the history of stock prices is that the movement comes in short, sharp spurts upwards within days of big declines.” Doing nothing doesn’t feel good when you’re feeling stressed about investments tanking in a potential market decline. One solution is to hang on to cash reserves that can provide stability and flexibility. “When there's chaos around you, identify one move, one thing that you can do to help and that makes you feel more in control,” Harris said. For Harris, and I wholeheartedly agree, the one move to make is to load up on cash. “In case there’s a recession up the road, or you face a layoff, you’ll never be ill served by having more cash on hand,” she said. “When you build up your cash reserves, suddenly you've taken control of a situation that feels out of control for you.” It doesn't really differ by generation. Whether you’re younger or older, you want to try to stay the course as long as the course that you are on is right, and as long as you're not a hundred percent in stocks or a hundred percent in cash, according to Harris. “The goal is to have a balanced portfolio, especially for your stage of life,” she said. Harris is spot on. The aim is to maintain a portfolio that’s properly allocated and diversified based on your investment objectives. Financial advisers generally suggest rebalancing (adjusting your mix of stocks and bonds) whenever your portfolio gets more than 7% to 10% away from your original asset allocation, which was built to match your time horizon, risk tolerance, and financial goals. To roughly determine what percentage of your portfolio should be in stocks, subtract your age from 110. So, a 60-year-old would have 50% in stocks and the rest in bonds and cash. “If you’re going to retire within the next five years, or you have recently retired, then stock market drops can have a really big impact on your long-term financial security, your nest egg,” Harris said. “You want to be cautious. If you're withdrawing money, you may want to withdraw a little bit less. You do a little tinkering around the edges to be safe.” Taking out risk Christine Benz, the director of personal finance and retirement planning for Morningstar, is the author of “How to Retire: 20 Lessons for a Happy, Successful, and Wealthy Retirement.” “For investors worried about the turmoil who still have a long runway to retirement — under age 50 or so — their portfolios should be predominantly in stocks,” Benz said. “However, it's smart to revisit US/non-US exposure. Non-US stocks have dramatically outperformed US so far this year, but non-US stock prices are still relatively inexpensive, and there have been long stretches when non-US stocks have performed better than US.” Try a global stock index like the Vanguard Total World Index. It currently owns US and non-US companies in proportion to their market values, and it's 65% US/35% non-US. That makes it a decent benchmark for people trying to decide how much to stake overseas. President Donald Trump delivers an address to the nation at the White House in Washington, D.C., June 21, following US strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. REUTERS/Carlos Barria/Pool/File Photo · Reuters / Reuters For those over 50 and getting closer to retirement, it makes sense to start taking some risk out of the portfolio, according to Benz. “Stocks should still consume a heavy share of their portfolios (and it's worth taking a look at US/non-US exposure at this life stage too). But as you get closer to spending from your portfolio, steering some money toward bonds or bond funds/ETFs is a good strategy. High-quality bonds like Treasurys have a good track record of holding their ground, or even gaining value in stock-market downdrafts.” The beauty of that strategy is that if stocks go down — and stay down for a sustained period, and you need to pull cash from your portfolio because you're retired — you could take it from the appreciated assets and leave the stocks alone, Benz said. If someone is closing in on or in retirement, Benz recommends holding a buffer of cash and bonds amounting to seven to 10 years' worth of anticipated cash-flow needs (above and beyond what they'd receive from Social Security or a pension). The good news is that yields are now decent on bonds and cash instruments, so you get paid while you wait, she said. “Inflation is a risk factor for this part of the portfolio, though, which is why investors shouldn't overdo their exposure to ‘safe’ assets and why they should consider embedding direct inflation protection with I-bonds and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities.” That’s solid advice. When you’re close to stepping away from a steady paycheck, or already retired, you should have at least five years' worth of living expenses in a combination of high-yielding savings accounts, CDs, money market funds, and high-quality bonds.

If you’re investing money automatically in your employer-sponsored retirement plan or an IRA, you're investing when the market is ripping and when it’s tanking, and that means the return on your investments evens out over the long haul. If you’re like many retirement savers and invest in a target-date retirement fund , your account is automatically adjusting for market gyrations. With a target-date retirement fund, you pick the year you’d like to retire and buy a mutual fund with that year in its name (like Target 2044). The fund manager then splits up your investment between stocks and bonds, typically both US and international, changing that balance to a more conservative blend as the target date approaches.

‘Overly optimistic’ OBR blows £18bn hole in Reeves’s Budget,2025-07-02 16:00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/overly-optimistic-obr-blows-18bn-070000667.html,"Rachel Reeves faces an £18bn black hole in her next Budget after the UK’s fiscal watchdog admitted it had been too optimistic on growth. On Tuesday, the Office for Budget Responsibility said it had overestimated the pace of growth of the economy , delivering a setback to the Chancellor as she prepares to start crafting the autumn Budget. JP Morgan warned that the admission of optimism bias from the OBR means it is likely that the tax-and-spending watchdog will downgrade its growth estimates at the next Budget. It would mark a fresh blow for the Chancellor as any cut to UK’s economic growth “will lead to a deterioration in measured headroom around the fiscal rules”, according to the bank. JP Morgan is predicting that the OBR will downgrade its forecast for average annual GDP growth by 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points. The bank estimates the cut to economic growth would result in a £9bn to £18bn decline in fiscal headroom, piling further pressure on Ms Reeves. Economists had previously forecast that Ms Reeves could be facing a black hole of anywhere between £10bn and £20bn. Satirical artist Kaya Mar holds a painting of Rachel Reeves, who has been put in a difficult position by Labour’s policy reversals - Henry Nicholls/AFP via Getty “If higher tariffs persist, the OBR might lean towards the upper end of that range. Given current headroom is limited at £9.9bn, this assumption alone would be sufficient to wipe most of that out and potentially generate a shortfall,” said Allan Monks, at JP Morgan. “It appears likely that there will be pressure to raise taxes at the Budget,” he added. Mr Monks had already forecast that the Chancellor is facing a £20bn black hole but the admission of over-optimism by the OBR in its report further spells out the mounting challenge facing the Treasury. In the Spring Statement in March, Ms Reeves left herself with just £9.9bn in fiscal headroom. However, this buffer has been put under pressure by a series of policy reversals by Sir Keir Starmer . Climbdowns on sickness and disability benefits has left the Chancellor with a shortfall of around £2.5bn, on top of a £1.25bn hit from backtracking on winter fuel payment cuts . A small increase in borrowing costs has also put a dent in the Government’s fiscal headroom. The added pressure on Ms Reeves’s purse strings could mean another record tax raid in the upcoming autumn Budget. The Chancellor had previously pledged not to repeat last year’s tax raid in which she raised employers’ National Insurance contributions . In its forecast evaluation report, which is produced by the OBR every two years, the watchdog acknowledged that since 2010 it had overestimated the UK’s annual GDP growth in its five-year forecasts. The OBR added that weak productivity since the financial crisis had weighed on growth and caused an overshoot in its forecasts. The watchdog said in the early 2010s there had been a “persistent overestimate” of GDP growth as productivity did not rise to average historical levels. The anticipated downgrade to GDP growth by the OBR adds to the growing black hole in the Chancellor’s finances. Reeves backed into corner Ms Reeves has left herself with few options to plug the shortfall. As part of Labour’s manifesto pledges the Chancellor has previously committed to not increase the rates of income tax, National Insurance or VAT, nor to raise corporation tax. As a result, businesses are likely to be targeted again in the autumn. Freezing the threshold for the additional rate of income tax was one of the suggestions in a memo from Angela Rayner, the Deputy Prime Minister, to the Chancellor, The Telegraph reported in May . The current freeze, which was due to be lifted in 2028, forced an extra 520,000 taxpayers into the 40p bracket in the last year, according to estimates by HMRC. Economists have said a further freeze in the autumn is now all but certain, and that additional increases on smaller taxes or a new raid on pensions could be required to make up the shortfall.

Why Bloom Energy Stock Blasted Nearly 30% Higher Last Month,2025-07-02 15:44:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-bloom-energy-stock-blasted-064437163.html,"Key Points The company stands to benefit from the Big, Beautiful Bill. It's also well positioned to help serve the needs of a hot new technology. 10 stocks we like better than Bloom Energy › The future of the energy industry was firmly on the minds of American investors in June. The Big, Beautiful Bill championed by President Trump was making its way through Congress, and a series of its provisions concerned the sector. New proposals essentially favored certain types of energy production over others. Luckily for Bloom Energy (NYSE: BE) , it was one of the beneficiaries. That put it in a particularly advantageous position, as the U.S. will surely be coping with increased demand for energy sources in the years to come. It didn't come as a surprise, then, that an analyst reiterated his positive view of Bloom's future in a research note published near the start of the month. Image source: Getty Images. A pundit stays the course The analyst in question was RBC Capital's Christopher Dendrinos, who is holding fast to his outperform (read: buy) recommendation and $26 per share price target for Bloom. Dendrinos's position is based on that much-anticipated spike in demand for energy, according to reports. The analyst pointed out that the company has both short- and long-term opportunities presented by that rise, which to no small extent is due to the rapid emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Bloom appears particularly well positioned for the Age of AI. Data centers designed for the technology need reliable sources of power that can be provided in significant volume and, ideally, are clean compared to other generation methods. The company's energy servers are quite suited for this work. As the month went by, Bloom became more of an apparent winner with Trump's budget reconciliation bill. In the version that was ultimately passed by the Senate certain types of energy production would be affected by a change making it harder for them to obtain federal tax credits. This applies to solar and wind projects, however, and not the natural gas or hydrogen offerings that are Bloom's specialties. In fact, the bill gives hydrogen energy developers an extension on federal tax credits, and generally supports the more traditional natural gas segment. The Big, Beautiful Bill still has to pass a fresh vote in the House of Representatives. There are apparently some holdouts in Trump's Republican party in the chamber, so success is by no means assured -- it could face tough challenges as it did with senators. Betting on the bill Bloom's future depends rather heavily on the bill's ultimate fate. However, I think that even if the hydrogen/natural gas-favoring provisions in the final Senate version are reduced in some way those technologies would still be given advantages. Meanwhile, the company is one of the younger and more innovative players in its industry, which is still dominated by fairly traditional power producers. I think that tech has real potential, and the latest moves by our nation's lawmakers are sure to give it at least something of a tailwind. It's a risky stock to own, but one that seems like a decent bet these days. Should you invest $1,000 in Bloom Energy right now?

UK’s retail inflation is back as govt costs squeeze retailers,2025-07-02 15:26:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/uk-retail-inflation-back-govt-062624438.html,"Shop price inflation has returned to the UK’s high streets, with overall shop prices rising 0.4% year on year in June 2025, reversing the -0.1% decline seen in May. The figures, released by the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and NielsenIQ, reveal mounting cost pressures are translating into higher prices at the tills, particularly in food categories, as retailers grapple with increased government-imposed costs. Food inflation surges on meat and produce costs Food price inflation accelerated to 3.7% in June, up from 2.8% the previous month. Fresh food rose 3.2% year on year, with prices of meat especially affected by elevated wholesale costs and higher wages driven by April’s National Living Wage increase. Fruit and vegetable prices also climbed, attributed to hot, dry weather conditions that reduced crop yields across parts of the UK and Europe. Helen Dickinson, Chief Executive of the BRC, said retailers are struggling with “high wholesale prices and more expensive labour costs,” which are pushing food prices higher. She warned that geopolitical tensions and climate-related events could lead to “a significant rise in food inflation by the end of this year.” Meanwhile, ambient food inflation, which covers products with longer shelf lives, reached 4.3% in June, up from 3.3% in May, outpacing the three-month average of 3.8%. These figures highlight persistent cost pressures that continue to feed through the supply chain. Non-food deflation slows despite consumer spending boost In contrast, non-food prices remained in deflation at -1.2% year on year in June, though the rate of decline slowed compared with -1.5% in May. Retailers have been discounting products in categories like DIY and gardening to attract customers eager to take advantage of recent sunny weather. Mike Watkins, Head of Retailer and Business Insight at NielsenIQ, noted that while warmer weather is helping to drive footfall and sales, “rising prices could become a concern if consumer willingness to spend declines later in the year.” He added that retailers will likely need to reinforce value-for-money messaging to maintain shopper engagement over the coming months. Non-food retailers’ efforts to stimulate demand reflect broader caution about consumers’ spending power as essential costs, including food, energy, and housing, continue to rise faster than wages for many households. Government urged to act as costs pile up for retailers Retail industry leaders have pointed to increased Employer National Insurance contributions and the higher National Living Wage introduced in April as key factors behind the return of inflation in shop prices. According to the BRC, these additional costs, set out in last autumn’s Budget, have weighed heavily on businesses within just three months of implementation. Dickinson stressed the importance of upcoming government decisions, saying, “To limit further rises, Government must find ways to alleviate the cost pressures bearing down on retailers. The upcoming business rates reform offers such an opportunity, and the Government must ensure no shop pays more as a result of the changes.” Retailers are also concerned that geopolitical instability and climate-related events could further disrupt supply chains, pushing prices higher. The combined effect of these pressures could prolong the period of elevated shop price inflation, affecting consumers’ purchasing power into the second half of 2025.

Morning Bid: Markets sit tight for trade progress,2025-07-02 13:31:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morning-bid-markets-sit-tight-043145250.html,"A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Ankur Banerjee Markets shrugged off the U.S. Senate passing President Donald Trump's ""big, beautiful bill"", with investor attention fixed to the path for U.S. interest rates and trade deals ahead of the United States' re-imposition of tariffs on July 9. Trump's tirade against the Federal Reserve and its Chair Jerome Powell to lower rates has stoked investor worries of the central bank's independence and credibility. It has also led to traders pricing in the possibility of early rate cuts. But Powell, at a central bank gathering in Portugal, reiterated that the Fed plans to ""wait and learn more"" about the impact of tariffs on inflation before lowering interest rates. That, along with relatively upbeat labour data on Tuesday, has left investors none the wiser about when the Fed would cut rates and watching out for Thursday's nonfarm payrolls data for cues. European stocks are set for a slightly higher open after a mixed Asian session, where Japan's Nikkei dropped 0.75% whereas Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index gained 0.75%. TARIFF DAY Trump's tax bill, which will add to the already enormous U.S. debt pile, slash taxes, reduce social safety net programs and boost military and immigration enforcement spending, now heads to the House of Representatives for possible final approval. Meanwhile, with the July 9 tariff day creeping closer, countries are scrambling to agree trade deals with the U.S. India is likely ink a deal whereas Japan is not, Trump said. All that has left markets in flux as we head into the second half of the year. The first half was dominated by relentless U.S. dollar selling as investors grappled with Trump's chaotic trade policies and looked for alternative places to park their money. The euro has had a blistering 2025 so far gaining 14% and perched at its highest level since September 2021, but whether it could replace the dollar as the world's reserve currency of choice is an open question. Central bankers gathered for an annual conference in the Portuguese resort of Sintra do not expect a major challenge to the dollar's status any time soon. ""It's not going to happen just like that overnight. It never did historically,"" said European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde. ""But there is clearly something that has been broken. Whether it is fixable, or whether it is going to continue to be broken - I think the jury's out.""

‘Never selling’ investor outlines ambitious Bitcoin price targets,2025-07-02 08:16:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/never-selling-investor-outlines-ambitious-231639012.html,"‘Never selling’ investor outlines ambitious Bitcoin price targets originally appeared on TheStreet . Siddarth Bharwani, Joint Managing Director and CFO of Jetking, told TheStreet Roundtable that the classic Bitcoin cycle theory is “getting slightly disrupted” as geopolitical turmoil fails to dent the market. Jetking designated Bitcoin as its primary treasury asset in December 2024. Under Siddarth Bharwani’s phased plan, the company aims to hold 210 Bitcoin by the end of 2025 and amass 18,000 Bitcoin by 2030. “The world went through a storm in the last six months and Bitcoin did not have a very extreme reaction,” he said, contrasting today’s stability with the 60% – 70% COVID -era sell-off. Cycle theory disrupted Bharwani argues that Bitcoin’s drivers are shifting. “2010 to 2020 was all the community and retail driving Bitcoin. 2020 to 2030 is going to be corporations driving Bitcoin. And 2030 onwards will be countries driving Bitcoin,” he said. That evolution reflects growing institutional involvement, which he believes will “start getting slightly less volatile than it was before.” As evidence, he pointed to recent tariff wars and conflicts in the Middle East failing to provoke sharp price swings. “If you see the world went through a storm, Bitcoin was still chilling,” he said, underscoring the asset’s maturing market dynamics. Price outlook When asked where Bitcoin tops in the current cycle, Bharwani offered a short-term target of about $150,000 to $160,000. “I don’t think the market cap will move three or four times in this year,” he noted, though he acknowledged higher moves over a longer horizon. Looking further ahead, he forecast that by the 2032 halving cycle — “two cycles away” — Bitcoin’s market capitalization could reach $9 trillion to $10 trillion, implying a price of roughly $600,000 to $700,000. “That is conservative,” he said, contrasting his view with more bullish predictions of $2 million or $3 million. ‘Never selling’ investor outlines ambitious Bitcoin price targets first appeared on TheStreet on Jul 1, 2025 This story was originally reported by TheStreet on Jul 1, 2025, where it first appeared."

Tech entrepreneur and former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan has commented on the escalating feud between President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk — and the message is clear. On July 1, Balaji posted on X, stating, ""The US is broke,"" and claimed there is ""real debt"" in excess of $175 trillion, adding that America is in such dire straits that it must deal with “national bankruptcy."" Supporting Musk's recent criticism of Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill"" — a tax and spending package Musk believes could lead to the collapse of the U.S. dollar — Balaji stated that Elon Musk is 100% correct on the numbers."" He took the discussion a step further, saying there is no fix, only ""a writeoff,"" and that the U.S. will default through inflation and ""money printing."" Along with his message, Balaji posted a chart showing the U.S. National debt as a percentage of GDP over the past 150 years. T he chart clearly showed dramatic increases in debt over the period, with some pronounced increases following the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Trump tariffs live updates: Trump suggests he won't extend tariff pause, floats higher tariff level for Japan",2025-07-02 05:12:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/trump-tariffs-live-updates-trump-suggests-he-wont-extend-tariff-pause-floats-higher-tariff-level-for-japan-200619825.html,"On Tuesday, President Trump renewed threats that he may stick to his self-imposed July 9 deadline for making trade deals and issue new tariff levels to trading partners, forgoing another pause to ""Liberation Day"" duties. ""No, I'm not thinking about the pause,"" Trump said aboard Air Force One when asked if he would extend the tariff pause, per Bloomberg . ""I’ll be writing letters to a lot of countries."" The president's comments come after a Financial Times report Tuesday suggested that Trump's team is no longer aiming for big trade deals with many countries. Instead, they are trying to make smaller, quick agreements before July 9, when Trump plans to bring back his toughest tariffs. These mini deals could help countries avoid those harsh levies, but partners would still face existing tariffs while talks continue. Talks continue to take place, and Trump is still threatening new tariffs on key sectors like cars, steel, and aluminum — and on key trading partners like Japan. Trump stated that his team would force Japan to accept higher tariffs of ""30%, 35% or whatever the number is that we determine."" Notably, that proposal is higher than the 24% ""Liberation Day"" level and the current baseline 10% tariffs in place while the two sides negotiate. “I’m not sure we’re going to make a deal,"" Trump said Tuesday. ""I doubt it with Japan. They’re very tough. You have to understand, they’re very spoiled."" Top administration officials have been providing mixed signals on the malleability of the July 9 deadline while countries race to finalize talks. But on Monday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had warned that ""recalcitrant"" countries would face a return of steep ""Liberation Day"" tariffs. Meanwhile, the European Union has signaled it was willing to accept a 10% universal tariff on many of its exports but is seeking exemptions for pharmaceuticals, alcohol, semiconductors, and commercial aircraft as part of a trade deal, Bloomberg reported . The EU is also seeking quotas and exemptions to lower duties on autos, steel, and aluminum, the report said. On the North American front, Canada scrapped its digital services tax on US technology companies, such as Apple ( AAPL ), Amazon ( AMZN ), and Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ) late on Sunday . The White House said trade talks between the two countries had resumed after Trump threatened to cut off trade talks.

He also threatened a tariff level on goods from Japan that would be higher than those he levied on the country in April. From Bloomberg : Notably, that 30% or 35% would be a higher level than the 24% he had laid out as part of his ""Liberation Day"" duties.

Tue, July 1, 2025 at 1:59 PM UTC Grace O'Donnell Powell: Fed likely would have cut rates if not for tariffs Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said that tariffs are causing the central bank to take its time before cutting interest rates. Powell is speaking today about the Fed's policy stance at an ECB forum in Sintra, Portugal. When asked if the Fed would have cut interest rates by more by now if it weren't for higher tariffs, Powell stated, ""I think that’s right."" ""In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs,"" Powell continued. ""Essentially, all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs."" Powell noted that the US economy remains healthy overall but that he expects to see the effects of tariffs if they filter through the economic data in the coming months. In recent days, Powell has faced increased pressure from President Trump to lower interest rates, including in the form of handwritten notes. ""Ignore the tariffs for a second,"" Powell said of the economy. ""Inflation is behaving pretty much exactly as we have expected and hoped that it would. We haven't seen effects much yet from tariffs, and we didn't expect to by now.""

India is currently on track to seal an interim trade agreement with the US as soon as next week, according to a report in the FT on Tuesday. The FT, who received exclusive information from people briefed on the talks, reported that an interim deal between the US and India would be a step closer to a comprehensive bilateral accord between Washington and New Delhi. It would also be the first with a major US trading partner. The FT reports: Read more here. Tue, July 1, 2025 at 8:24 AM UTC Jenny McCall US narrows trade focus to secure deals before Donald Trump’s tariff deadline President Trump's team has decided to focus on smaller trade deals instead of big, wide-ranging agreements, according to a report in the FT, who cited people familiar with the matter. The Trump administration is hoping these quick deals will stop the US from bringing back tough tariffs. Officials want to reach phased deals with countries that are most ready to talk before July 9. That is when Trump plans to reimpose harsh tariffs if no agreements are made. These smaller deals mean countries could avoid the worst tariffs for now. But they would still face some existing tariffs while talks on harder issues continue. Talks remain complicated and Trump is also thinking about new tariffs on key industries. This approach shows how he uses the threat of tariffs to push countries to agree to US demands.

Mon, June 30, 2025 at 6:37 PM UTC Grace O'Donnell Trump says he will be sending Japan a letter, threatening new tariff levels President Trump said on Monday afternoon he was willing to impose a higher tariff rate on Japan, saying the country refused to accept US rice exports. ""To show people how spoiled Countries have become with respect to the United States of America, and I have great respect for Japan, they won’t take our RICE, and yet they have a massive rice shortage,"" Trump posted on Truth Social . ""In other words, we’ll just be sending them a letter, and we love having them as a Trading Partner for many years to come."" Trump's statement that he would send a letter to Japan outlining the new tariff rate comes a little more than a week before a July 9 deadline and after months of being locked in trade talks with Japanese leaders. Trump has threatened to send letters to trading partners should negotiations break down. During trade talks, Japan has sought an exemption from the Trump administration's 25% auto duties. Broad tariffs on Japanese goods were set to jump back up to 24% on July 9 if no deal is reached and the tariff pause is not extended. Read more here.

""It seems some countries will reach a deal by July 8, some might be granted an extension to continue negotiations, while others will decide if they want to continue negotiating under tariffs or not,"" the South Korean official told a briefing. Here's how some of the other trading partners are managing the deadline. China The US and China reached a deal to resume rare earth exports in London this month, resolving delays in implementing the Geneva agreement, which was established in May. Both sides are keen to ease tensions before tariffs rise further on August 9, when broader duties could rise 50%. Canada Canada scrapped its planned digital services tax targeting US tech firms on Sunday in an attempt to revive stalled talks. President Trump threatened new tariffs within a week if no deal is reached. According to Reuters, talks aim for an agreement by July 21. EU EU negotiators are pushing to keep reciprocal tariffs below 10% but Washington is pursuing a 10% baseline rate on most goods. Talks continue as the EU faces a looming deadline of July 9. UK The US-UK trade deal was cemented at the G-7 Summit this month. The deal came into force this week, reducing levies on cars and aircraft parts but keeping 10% tariffs on exports. Steel and aluminium tariffs remain unresloved ahead of the July 9 deadline. Japan Japan is seeking exemption from US auto tariffs, which currently stand at 25%, while also facing a new 24% reciprocal tariff from July 9. Trump wants Japan to import more US energy to reduce its trade surplus. Mexico The US and Mexico are negotiating a quota deal to reduce Trump's 50% steel tariffs. An agreement may allow for lower import rates.

A short‑term surge in shipments to the United States, partly the result of firms rushing orders ahead of new tariff rules, has bolstered factory orders and lifted purchasing‑managers’ indices in Vietnam and Thailand. Singapore has seen a jump in re‑exports bound for the U.S., while Malaysia and Vietnam logged wider gains in direct exports.

Domestic demand also looks resilient. Unemployment across the six major ASEAN economies is below pre‑pandemic levels and governments have rolled out targeted fiscal measures while they monitor U.S. trade policy, BofA said. Analyst cautioned that the front‑loading of orders is temporary and expects “eventual exports and inventory pay‑back” to weigh on growth from late 2025. It left projections unchanged for the Philippines, which is less exposed to U.S. tariffs, and sees Thailand lagging as local factors drag on activity. Inflation is forecast to stay within, or below, central‑bank comfort zones as subdued domestic demand caps price pressures. Food‑cost risks remain limited absent severe weather shocks. Central banks retain an easing bias, but BofA expects deeper rate‑cut cycles at Bank Indonesia, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas and the Bank of Thailand than at Bank Negara Malaysia and the Monetary Authority of Singapore.

"What is the U.S. debt ceiling, and how does it impact you?",2025-07-02 04:33:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/banking/article/what-is-the-us-debt-ceiling-225639897.html,"Let's say you have a credit card with a $5,000 spending limit . For some reason, the card company approves $6,000 in charges. You call them and ask, ""Did you raise my spending limit?"" They say, ""No, but we will consider it."" In the meantime, they demand payment in full immediately. ""But the charges are already approved!"" you insist. The card company threatens to close your account because you've spent over the credit limit. Your credit history could be ruined. You may even have to file bankruptcy. Eventually, they relent and raise your credit limit. Financial disaster averted. That's somewhat like what's happening with the government debt ceiling, the threat of government shutdowns , and the political showdowns that occur every few months. In this article: What is the U.S. debt ceiling? Why does the government have a debt ceiling? What happens when the debt ceiling is raised? What if Congress doesn’t raise the debt ceiling? Using ‘extraordinary measures’ to keep the government open What if there was no debt ceiling? FAQs What is the U.S. debt ceiling? Like many Americans, the federal government spends more money than it makes. The difference is that the U.S. Treasury can issue bonds it sells to investors to fund its operation. It's borrowing capital from anyone who wants to buy American debt. Congress established the first federal debt limit of $45 billion in 1939. It was an attempt to cap government spending. How's that working? The national debt now stands at over $36 trillion. Why does the government have a debt ceiling? During the budget and appropriations process, Congress decides how much money is needed to fund the military and national defense, social and health programs, Medicare and Social Security — and the interest payments on the nation's debt. As of May 2025, it costs $776 billion to maintain the nation's debt. Since the U.S. government uses debt to meet current obligations, the debt ceiling is not about approving new spending. It's about paying the bills currently owed. The debt ceiling is an attempt to put a limit on federal spending — after Congress has already approved it. It's a horse-after-the-cart thing. So, what's the point of a debt ceiling? ""I don't think it's so bad because it does remind people there is a debt,"" Kathleen Day, lecturer on economic crises at Johns Hopkins Carey Business School, told Yahoo Finance in a phone interview. However, she said lawmakers should be exercising their objections and authority during the federal budget process, not with the debt ceiling. ""Many in Congress misuse appropriations and the debt ceiling to try to get done what they couldn't get done in the budget process,"" she added. Learn more: What happens to Social Security payments during a government shutdown? What happens when the debt ceiling is raised? Raising the debt limit increases the amount of money the government can borrow to pay current financial commitments. It's like raising a credit card's spending limit to pay for already approved charges, like in our above example. What if Congress doesn't raise the debt ceiling? Day said the biggest risk of not raising the debt ceiling is damaging the country's credit. A default could trigger a financial disaster roiling the markets and the U.S. economy, causing a massive loss of jobs and the interruption of government benefits. ""It used to be no one would take seriously any idea that the U.S. wouldn't pay its obligations,"" Day said. ""People no longer can say without a doubt, 'Oh, the U.S. would never let that happen.'"" Even a slight delay in government funding due to a debt-ceiling standoff would ""make money more expensive,"" she said, by drastically raising interest rates. Using 'extraordinary measures' to keep the government open When the government bumps up against the debt limit, the Department of the Treasury uses what it calls ""extraordinary measures"" to pay its bills. It's a short-term shell game. Simply stated, it includes tapping cash reserves, suspending some investments in government benefit funds, and delaying the sale of savings bonds . What if there was no debt ceiling? Replacing the debt ceiling process with something less economically traumatic has been floated numerous times. The U.S. Government Accountability Office urged just such a change as recently as December 2024. The GAO recommended that Congress immediately replace ""... the debt limit process with one that requires decisions on debt to be made at the same time as decisions on spending and revenue."" The GAO added that the debt limit impasses also don't address the spending and revenue issues contributing to the nation's growing debt. It also said that negotiating the debt limit at the last second makes a government default even more likely. This would ""disrupt financial markets"" and ""inflict long-lasting damage to the U.S. and global economies."" Dig deeper: 2025 financial forecast — what to expect in mortgages, banking, investing, and credit cards U.S. debt ceiling FAQs What is the current debt ceiling? The current debt ceiling was temporarily set at the amount the government owed on Jan. 1, 2025. Because Congress could not agree on a new debt ceiling, it used an interim funding tool called a continuing resolution to avoid a government shutdown. It's a budget patch Congress has used many times over the past nearly three decades. It essentially kicked the can down the road for another faceoff by mid-August to late September. Who is the U.S. most in debt to? Most federal debt is issued in Treasury securities held by investors in the U.S. Beyond that, the government itself holds Treasurys in the Federal Reserve System . Then, mutual funds, financial institutions, and state and local governments account for the next largest share of U.S. debt. Japan is the largest holder of American debt among foreign countries, followed by China, the UK, and nearly three dozen other countries. Can the U.S. get out of debt? The U.S. debt is greater than the nation's economy. Paying it off would be a monumental task. Instead, the more likely scenario would be the ""responsible"" management of the government's budget and debt, Kathleen Day said. ""You don't want to say, 'Hey, let's all save up to build that factory.' No, borrow money, build a factory, put people to work, boost the economy, and pay back the loan, and you do it again.""

What’s in the Trump Tax Bill That Just Passed the Senate,2025-07-02 04:06:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-tax-bill-just-passed-175159183.html,"(Bloomberg) — President Donald Trump’s multitrillion-dollar tax and spending package moved closer to reality after it passed the Senate Tuesday . Most Read from Bloomberg Struggling Downtowns Are Looking to Lure New Crowds Philadelphia Transit System Votes to Cut Service by 45%, Hike Fares Sprawl Is Still Not the Answer California Exempts Building Projects From Environmental Law Republican senators altered an earlier version approved by the House to make deeper cuts to safety-net programs such as the Medicaid health insurance for the poor and disabled. The Senate bill also would speed up elimination of clean energy tax breaks. Businesses benefit from Senate changes that would make permanent a series of breaks that had been offered only temporarily in a House version, as well as a more generous break for companies in high-tax states. The president’s signature economic legislation would extend expiring tax cuts for businesses and individuals initially passed in 2017 and add temporary new breaks for tipped and overtime workers, the elderly and car-buyers who take out loans. It provides hundreds of billions of dollars in new funding for defense and for Trump’s immigration crackdown. The House plans to vote on the bill Wednesday as Republicans rush to complete work on the legislation by a July 4 deadline Trump set. Here’s a breakdown of key provisions in the latest version of Trump’s tax bill: State and Local Tax Deduction The Senate legislation incorporates a deal to raise the limit on the state and local tax deduction to $40,000 annually for a five-year period. The write-off would phase out for taxpayers who make more than $500,000 per year. After the five-year period, the limit would snap back to the current $10,000 limit imposed in the 2017 tax law. The higher limit was demanded by Republican House members who represent states with high taxes such as New York, California and New Jersey. One key holdout wasn’t satisfied: New York’s Nick LaLota. He wants the higher limit maintained for at least 10 years and said he will vote against the legislation in the House as a result. FILE - Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y., speaks during a news conference, July 14, 2023, on Capitol Hill in Washington. LaLota is the Republican candidate in New York's 1st District. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File) · ASSOCIATED PRESS The Senate also dropped new limits House Republicans had put on pass-through businesses’ deductions of state and local tax taxes. Some business owners don’t need to abide by the SALT cap that applies to everyone else, thanks to legal workarounds approved by legislatures in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, California and dozens of other states. No Tax on Tips Workers would be exempt from taxes on tip income up to $25,000 per individual, as well as overtime up to $12,500 per individual and $25,000 per couple. The tax breaks run through 2028. Those deductions start to phase out at $150,000 in income per person. Medicaid Spending on Medicaid health insurance would be cut by nearly $1 trillion over 10 years, and 11.8 million Americans would lose health insurance, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that doesn’t include last-minute adjustments The measure would put a new limit on a mechanism nearly all states use to increase federal Medicaid funding. The legislation would cap so-called provider taxes that states use toward defraying their Medicaid matching fund requirements, allowing them to bring in more federal money to make Medicaid payments to providers and expand coverage. The cap would be phased in beginning in 2028 for states that expanded Medicaid coverage for low-income people under the Affordable Care Act. According to the the nonpartisan health policy research group KFF, 40 states and the District of Columbia have done so. The measure would create new work requirements for Medicaid recipients, unless they are elderly, disabled or have children under 14 years old. Medicaid beneficiaries who gained eligibility through the Affordable Care Act would have to pay a share of costs through charges like co-pays. Rural Hospital Fund The Senate added a $50 billion rural hospital fund, an effort to mitigate the impact of Medicaid cuts on those institutions. Rural lawmakers raised concerns the Medicaid cuts would force local hospitals to close.

REUTERS/Andrew Boyers/File Photo · Reuters / Reuters Clean Energy GOP senators fast-tracked a phase-out of green energy tax credits, including wind and solar power. The revised bill would require wind and solar projects to be in service by the end of 2027 to receive the tax break, a shift from a more lenient previous version that required projects be under construction by that date to receive at least partial credit. The Senate-passed measure also did away with a planned excise tax on wind and solar projects that use a certain threshold of Chinese components, a blow to American manufacturers. Electric Vehicles A popular $7,500 tax credit for consumer purchases of new and used electric vehicles would end on Sept. 30, 2025, earlier than previous versions of the bill that would have eliminated the credit at the end of the year. SAUSALITO, CALIFORNIA - JUNE 12: In an aerial view, electric vehicles sit parked at a Tesla charging station on June 12, 2025 in Sausalito, California. U.S. President Donald Trump is set to sign a congressional resolution barring California's electric vehicle sales mandate that requires 100% of new car and light truck sales in the state be zero-emission vehicles by 2035. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) · Justin Sullivan via Getty Images Auto Loan Tax Deduction A deduction up to $10,000 would be established for interest payments on auto loans from 2025 through 2028. The tax break is only eligible for new vehicles whose final assembly is in the US. Permanent Business Tax Breaks Three business tax deductions would be made permanent. That includes the ability to use depreciation and amortization as the basis for interest expensing, the research and development write-off and a 100% bonus depreciation of certain property, including most machinery and factories. It’s a win for banks, who could see a surge in lending as companies have more cash freed up to invest in projects. Semiconductors An investment credit for semiconductor manufacturers would be increased to 35% from 25%, giving chipmakers more incentive to break ground on new facilities by an existing 2026 deadline. Child Tax Credit The maximum child tax credit would rise to $2,200 from $2,000 per child. It also would be made permanent and adjusted for inflation. Trump Child Accounts Parents, relatives and others would be able to contribute up to $5,000 in total annually to tax-deferred “Trump” investment accounts for children until they turn 18. Children who are US citizens born from 2025 through 2028—essentially, during Trump’s current term—would get a $1,000 contribution into their accounts from the federal government. Endowment Tax The current 1.4% tax on net investment income of private college and university endowments would go up for better-funded institutions. The new tiered tax rate structure would climb as high as 8% for colleges with the most endowment income per student. Consumer Protection The funding cap for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau would be cut almost in half to 6.5% of total operating expenses of the Federal Reserve System. It would slash resources for an institution established to combat abuses such as deceptive and predatory lending practices exposed by the 2008 financial crisis. Food Aid Food assistance for low-income Americans would be cut by expanding existing work requirements for federal food stamps to cover beneficiaries up to 65 years old. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP, as the program is known, currently only requires work documentation for recipients up to 60 years old. New cost-sharing requirements also would require states to cover a portion of food stamp benefits received by their residents. A partial waiver for Alaska and Hawaii was included to win the support of Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski. Border Wall and Detention Centers The president’s crackdown on undocumented migrants would get $45 billion for detention centers and nearly $47 billion for infrastructure at the southern border, including wall construction. Remittances Migrants and others who send money abroad would be taxed at 1% of the amount of the transfer. That’s a decrease from a 3.5% levy in the House version of the bill. —With assistance from Steven T. Dennis, Erik Wasson, Jennifer A. Dlouhy, Skye Witley and Rachel Cohrs Zhang.

Truck driver wages downshifting in 2025,2025-07-02 03:22:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/truck-driver-wages-downshifting-2025-182242886.html,"WASHINGTON — The rate of driver wage growth continued a downward trend in 2024 that pushed into the first quarter of this year as reduced demand for drivers could further depress pay, according to a new industry report. According to the latest data compiled by the American Transportation Research Institute (ATRI), after increasing by 10.8% in 2021 and 15.5% in 2022, driver wages increased by 7.6% percent in 2023 and 2.4% in 2024. “The rate of driver wage growth is on track to decelerate further during 2025,” ATRI noted in its trucking industry cost analysis update released on Tuesday, which revealed that wages increased only 0.9% during the first two months of 2025. The report notes that the slowing rate of overall national wage growth and an uptick in unemployment “means that there will be less upward pressure on driver wages from other industries competing for labor talent.” Truckload carrier driver wages and benefits (cents/mile) Source: ATRI Reduced demand for drivers could also be a factor in slowing wage growth this year, the report predicts. It note that the number of production and nonsupervisory employees in long-distance trucking, which can be considered a surrogate for truck drivers, declined from 685,100 in December 2023 to 672,500 in December 2024, although that number has since remained stable into the first quarter of this year. For trucking companies, driver wages, fuel and repair and maintenance expenses, and truck and trailer payments – which rose by 8.3% to a record high $0.39 per mile – all weighed heavily on carrier profits. “Carrier profitability suffered across all industry sectors under these pressures, as the findings show in stark detail,” according to ATRI. The report found that average operating margins were below 2% in every sector except LTL, with the truckload sector averaging -2.3% in 2024. Average Operating Margin by Fleet Size. Source: ATRI Last year the average operational cost of trucking decreased slightly by 0.4%, from $2.270 per mile in 2023 to $2.260 per mile, ATRI data shows. Excluding fuel, however, operational costs increased by 3.6% to $1.779 per mile, a 6.2 cents-per-mile increase over 2023, and “the highest costs ever recorded by ATRI for non-fuel operating costs,” the research group pointed out. ATRI also noted that while driver wage costs are unlikely to increase significantly in 2025 under current market conditions, they are also unlikely to recede. “A key uncertainty in this outlook, however, is the impact of tariffs. If truck driver demand remains steady at its present level, driver compensation costs could be exposed to any uptick in inflationary pressure resulting from tariffs. “Given these current labor market conditions in the trucking industry, driver benefits costs are poised to increase at a greater rate than driver wages in 2025.” Related articles : BMO’s Q2 earnings show no improvement in credit conditions for trucking Is $69,000 a year enough for driving a truck?

Fed's Powell says dollar swap lines remain important tool,2025-07-02 03:01:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/feds-powell-says-dollar-swap-180107364.html,"By Michael S. Derby NEW YORK (Reuters) -Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday the U.S. central bank has no plans to change how it offers dollar liquidity to other official entities. Speaking on the matter of the Fed's dollar swap lines system, Powell told a gathering held by the European Central Bank that ""we still have the same authorities, and we're still prepared to use them in situations where it's within our legal authorities and where we think it makes sense."" He added the dollar swap lines have made ""a big contribution"" to global financial stability. Fed dollar swap lines offer collateralized loans to eligible central banks to ensure dollar liquidity is not an issue for the global financial system. The current system, initiated during the global financial crisis, has been heavily used in times of crisis. Fed swap lines now in place can lend dollar and foreign currencies, although it is the dollar-related facility that has been where the action has been. The swap line usage level can often be viewed as a proxy for international financial stress. There has been some concern that the Fed's currency swap lines could be shuttered amid the Trump administration's retreat from multilateral international coordination and its broader skepticism over Fed actions, although so far, no action by elected officials has happened. The system may also face longer run challenges as the trade policy pursued by the president may threaten the status of the dollar as a global reserve currency, which could make American money less needed by other nations, in turn reducing the need to borrow dollars in times of stress. Speaking at the same central bank event, Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong noted that while the dollar swap lines had helped in times of trouble there were times when there could be local dollar liquidity issues the U.S. central bank could not address. ""Our understanding is that Fed cannot extend the swap lines in that case, and we have to self defense ourselves. That is why I think they're having an adequate, sufficient level of reserves is very important."" (Reporting by Michael S. Derby; Editing by Alison Williams)"
Capstone Green Energy Sees Financial Improvements in FY2025,2025-07-02 02:30:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/capstone-green-energy-sees-financial-173000377.html,"This article was first published on Rigzone here Capstone Green Energy Holdings Inc. has reported fourth quarter and annual revenues of $27.1 million and $85.6 million respectively for fiscal year 2025, compared to 2024 fourth quarter and annual revenues of $24.3 million and $91.2 million respectively. The company said in its report that the fourth-quarter revenue improved by $2.8 million year-over-year, driven by increased demand for products and services, as well as improved rental utilization rates within the company's Energy as a Service (EaaS) revenue stream. Slow product sales in the first half of the fiscal year caused a decrease of $5.7 million for the year. This was mainly due to restructuring hesitancy and instability in Europe, it said. Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2025 was $7.5 million, up $4.9 million from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. The company recorded a net loss of $0.1 million, compared to a net loss of $5.3 million for the same period in fiscal 2024. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 was $2.8 million, up $0.8 million from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. This improvement was mainly due to better gross margins and lower operating expenses, it said. Gross profit for FY2025 was $23.3 million, up from $14.3 million for FY2024, due to sales mix shift and price hikes. Net loss was $7.2 million, swinging from FY2024's net income of $7.4 million, which included a $32.5 million reorganization gain. Excluding this gain, the net loss was cut by $17.9 million, driven by better gross profit, lower expenses, and reduced costs. Take control of your future.

Fed Chair Powell hints at July interest rate cut,2025-07-02 02:22:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-chair-powell-hints-july-172220888.html,"Fed Chair Powell hints at July interest rate cut originally appeared on TheStreet . On July 1, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell spoke at the ECB Forum and conveyed caution regarding potential interest rate cuts, reiterating that policymakers are prepared to react to the data that emerges in an environment where economic uncertainty, created by protectionist trade policies, is present. Powell did not provide any indication about whether a rate cut is forthcoming in July, and stated, ""I really can't say it's going to depend on the data, and we are going meeting by meeting."" He also added, ""I mean, is it fair to say I know you know nothing is guaranteed. Number one, we all know this. July just too soon to seriously even consider a rate cut.” Earlier, Powell was referred to as ""a real dummy"" by President Donald Trump, who also accused him of costing the United States ""a fortune"" by keeping interest rates high. Crypto traders closely monitor inflation data and Fed announcements , as they have a direct impact on market sentiment and the flow of investment. If Powell mentions that rate cuts could occur earlier than expected, there could be bullish momentum in crypto markets. Regarding concerns about the world economic implications of protectionism, Powell discussed the potential impact on more vulnerable countries, especially South Korea, which is highly export-dependent. Join the discussion with Scott Melker on Roundtable here. He said also that tariff increases, such as the new 26% Italian tariff introduced on April 2, could impact GDP growth rates. Powell also said, ""We introduced two scenarios in the May round and in the May report. For me, they were very useful on either side. They weren't symmetric, by the way, but they're on either side. For me, they were very useful in terms of my decision making, because they helped me to answer the question, given the uncertainty."" Powell has remained level-headed even as President Donald Trump has forced him to cut rates several times. So far, a July rate cut might not been in the cards, as per Powell. The crypto markets, however, have taken the news with slight optimism. Bitcoin , which was trading at $106,000 due to Trump and Musk's feud over the Big Beautiful Bill, is now slightly up at $107,171.41, as per Kraken .

US LNG exports fall in June due to plant maintenance,2025-07-02 02:15:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-lng-exports-fall-june-171554010.html,"By Curtis Williams HOUSTON (Reuters) -U.S. liquefied natural gas exports fell to their second lowest monthly level for the year in June, as maintenance work at some of the country's largest export facilities hurt output, according to preliminary data from financial firm LSEG. The United States, the world's top exporter of LNG, sold 8.4 million metric tons of the superchilled gas during the month, down from 8.9 MT in May and well below April's record of 9.3 MT, LSEG data showed. The reduction in LNG exports was primarily due to seasonal maintenance, including at Cheniere's 4.5 billion cubic feet per day Sabine Pass facility in Louisiana and its 2.4 bcfd Corpus Christi plant in Texas. Cameron LNG's 2.0 bcfd plant in Louisiana also underwent maintenance, and there were unplanned unit outages at Freeport LNG's 2.1-bcfd plant in Texas, according to LSEG data. Maintenance at both Sabine Pass and Cameron LNG appeared to have ended by the last week of June, with the plants producing close to capacity, according to LSEG data. EUROPE DOMINATES PURCHASES Slower economic growth in Asia due to ongoing trade wars with the United States continues to impact demand for LNG, with a collective drop of 16 MT in imports during the first half of the year compared to the same months in 2024, according to Reuters data. In June, gas prices were slightly higher in Asia than in Europe, with the Asian benchmark Japan Korea Marker rising to $12.90 per mmBtu from $11.83 in May. This compares with the European benchmark Title Transfer Facility in the Netherlands, which rose to $12.38 per mmBtu in June from $11.68 in May. Even with a slight arbitrage favoring Asian exports, U.S. producers exported 5.53 MT or 66% of their LNG to Europe in June, below the 6.05 MT or 68% that went to Europe in May, LSEG data showed. Exports to Asia remained relatively low with 1.56 MT or 19% sold to that part of the world in June compared 1.88 MT or 21% of total exports in May, LSEG data showed. With Train 1 of LNG Canada's 14 mtpa plant exporting its first cargo on the last day of June, it is likely to compete favorably with U.S. LNG exports from the Gulf Coast due to its shorter sailing time to Asia. US EXPORTS MORE LNG CLOSER TO HOME With colder weather in some South American countries and problems securing enough domestic gas in Argentina, the United States stepped up its exports to Latin America with 0.81 MT or 10% of all cargoes going to the region. This compares to 0.66 MT or just over 7% in May, LSEG data shows. Argentina alone bought a combined 340,000 tons of LNG in June with the U.S. supplying one third of that, and Trinidad and Tobago supplying 230,000 tons, according to LSEG data. U.S. LNG exporters continued to show versatility, with exports to Egypt and South Africa in June, LSEG data showed. In June there were a number of deals announced between U.S. LNG developers and buyers in Asia that could result in even more LNG leaving U.S. ports over the next five years, and the country maintaining its position as the world's largest LNG exporter.

The firm also swapped out Kinsale Capital for M&T Bank, citing near-term growth headwinds for KNSL. “We continue to see meaningful long-term value [in KNSL], but believe persistent decelerating top-line growth headwinds may add NT pressure.” Meanwhile, M&T Bank is expected to benefit from “low-single digit revenue growth, better-than-expected operating efficiency, top-of-the-class credit, and capital optionality.” Warner Music Group replaces Netflix on the list, as Wolfe sees WMG poised to ease investor concerns in 2026 and benefit from a robust music industry outlook. “Music industry growth and labels’ share remain robust, and WMG looks set to accelerate,” the note said. With shares trading at a steep discount to rival Universal Music Group (AS:UMG), Wolfe estimates 12-month upside of +21% and a +24% total shareholder return. Among existing Alpha List names, Wolfe continues to favor Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Micron (NASDAQ:MU), Twilio (NYSE:TWLO), and Walmart (NYSE:WMT).

Allegiant's April 2025 Traffic Numbers Improve Year Over Year,2025-07-02 02:08:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/allegiants-april-2025-traffic-numbers-170800413.html,"Allegiant Travel Company ALGT recently reported encouraging traffic numbers for May 2025. Scheduled traffic (measured in revenue passenger miles) rose 10.2% from the May 2024 levels. Capacity (measured in available seat miles) for scheduled service rose 16.3% year over year. Although traffic improved on a year-over-year basis, it failed to outpace capacity expansion. As a result, the load factor (the percentage of seats filled by passengers) in May 2025 declined to 80.3% from 84.8% a year ago. Total departures (scheduled services) rose 16.2% in May 2025 from a year ago. Moreover, the company’s average stage length (miles) grew 0.2% year over year. For the total system (including scheduled service and fixed-fee contracts), Allegiant carried 9.4% more passengers in May 2025 than the year-ago levels. System-wide capacity improved 16.5% in May 2025 on a year-over-year basis. The fuel price per gallon in May 2025 is estimated to have been $2.37. Apart from ALGT, other airline companies like Copa Holdings, S.A. CPA, Controladora Vuela Compañía de Aviación VLRS and LATAM Airlines Group LTM have also reported May traffic numbers. Copa Holdings reported robust traffic numbers for May 2025, driven by upbeat air travel demand. Due to high passenger volumes, revenue passenger miles (RPM: a measure of traffic) improved on a year-over-year basis in May. To match the demand swell, CPA is increasing its capacity. In May, available seat miles (ASM: a measure of capacity) increased 7% year over year. RPM surged 7.5% year over year. Since traffic outpaced capacity expansion, the load factor (the percentage of seats filled by passengers) rose to 87.6% from 87.3% in May 2024. Mexican carrier Controladora Vuela Compañía de Aviación , or Volaris, recently reported a year-over-year increase in RPM for May. Volaris reported a 9% year-over-year increase in consolidated capacity (measured in available seat miles). The load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) decreased 4.3 percentage points to 81.8% on a consolidated basis. The metric fell as the increase in consolidated traffic (3.5%) was less than the increase in consolidated capacity. During May, Volaris transported 2.5 million passengers, up 4.2% year over year. On the domestic front, RPMs and ASMs increased 5.7% and 10.4%, respectively, from the May 2024 levels. The domestic load factor in May was 86.5%, a decrease of 3.8 percentage points from the year-ago levels. In international markets, RPM declined 0.2% year over year, while ASM rose 6.8% year over year. The international load factor decreased by 5.2 percentage points on a year-over-year basis to 74.7%. LATAM Airlines Group reported a year-over-year increase in revenue passenger kilometers (RPK: a measure of air traffic) for May 2025. LATAM Airlines reported a 7.2% year-over-year increase in consolidated capacity, measured in available seat kilometers (ASK). The uptick was driven by a 13% increase in LATAM Airlines Brazil’s domestic capacity. Additionally, a new route from Sao Paulo (Guarulhos) to Fernando de Noronha was launched in May, strengthening domestic connectivity within Brazil. LTM’s consolidated traffic, measured in revenue passenger kilometers (RPK), increased 9.6% year over year. As traffic outpaced capacity expansion, the consolidated load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) rose 1.8 percentage points from May 2024 to 83.1% in May 2025, maintaining healthy load factors across all business segments.

Is Nvidia the Top Artificial Intelligence Stock to Buy in July?,2025-07-02 02:00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-top-artificial-intelligence-stock-170000995.html,"Key Points Analysts are projecting that Nvidia's rapid growth will continue over the next few years. Capital expenditures on data centers are expected to reach $1 trillion annually by 2028. 10 stocks we like better than Nvidia › As we reach the halfway mark in 2025, it's clear that artificial intelligence (AI) remains a dominant theme in the market. This hasn't changed since the start of 2023, so some investors may be becoming a bit fatigued from all the AI-related hype. However, the reality is that there has never been a larger investment theme. Most AI hyperscalers are projecting record capital expenditures for 2025, primarily focused on expanding their cloud computing capacity for AI applications. That will help one company more than any other: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) . Nvidia has been the top AI stock pick for several years now, and it remains a strong choice for the future. But is it the best AI stock to buy in July? Image source: Getty Images. Data center growth isn't over Nvidia manufactures graphics processing units (GPUs) -- chips that were originally designed to allow computers to generate high-quality graphics in video games. What allows them to do that so well is that these chips are parallel processors -- specifically suited to handling the types of computations that can easily be broken down into a large number of small tasks that can be handled simultaneously. Among the types of high-performance workloads that fit that particular bill are training and running AI models. Nvidia has competitors in the data center GPU market, but none come close to the technology and supporting products that it offers. Most estimates peg its market share in that niche at around 90%, which is incredible considering the substantial amount of money spent on data centers. Data center spending is also projected to skyrocket over the next few years. During his keynote at Nvidia's 2025 GTC developer event, CEO Jensen Huang cited a third-party estimate that data center capital expenditures totaled $400 billion in 2024. Considering that Nvidia generated $115 billion in data center revenue during its fiscal 2025 (which encompassed most of 2024), it's clear that a solid chunk of that spending flowed its way. That same estimate also forecast that data center capital expenditures would rise to $1 trillion by 2028. If Nvidia can maintain its share of those expenditures, its revenue would more than double over that period. That presents quite the bullish case for Nvidia stock, and even if the actual spending comes in below the $1 trillion mark, the chipmaker's growth should still be impressive. AI computing capacity is far from being fully built out to the degree that the tech sector expects to need, which keeps the story behind Nvidia's stock intact. But is the stock priced at a reasonable level for new investors to capitalize on future growth? Nvidia's stock trades in line with its peers There's a common notion that Nvidia's stock has become quite expensive, but that's something investors need to get out of their heads. While it may have been true early on in the AI arms race, that's no longer the case. It trades today at 36 times forward earnings, which is right around where some of its big tech peers are trading -- and Nvidia is growing at a faster rate than they are. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts. Microsoft and Amazon trade for 37 and 34 times forward earnings, respectively. Yet during their most recently reported quarters, Microsoft grew its revenue at a 13% pace, while Amazon grew at a 9% pace. I'm not trying to argue that Nvidia is cheap, but its valuation is hovering around the same levels as its big tech peers. If its data center GPU sales grow at the rates that it expects, then the price today will be inconsequential years down the road. As a result, I'm confident in labeling Nvidia as the best AI stock to buy in July . Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

"Trading on protection against UK defaults jumped in Q1, says ISDA",2025-07-02 01:58:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trading-protection-against-uk-defaults-165853308.html,"By Nell Mackenzie LONDON (Reuters) -Trading of derivatives contracts that provide investors with protection against UK company defaults jumped almost 50% in the first quarter of 2025 to more than $2 trillion, an International Swaps and Derivatives Association report showed on Tuesday. WHY IT’S IMPORTANT Credit default swaps trading reported in the UK rose by 47% to $2.3 trillion, from $1.5 trillion in the first quarter of 2024, trade body ISDA reported. The volume of insurance protection investors took out on UK corporate bonds in the first quarter illustrates the scale of unease ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping import tariffs on April 2. While a UK/U.S. trade deal has since been signed, tariff uncertainty is a headwind for corporates globally as a July 9 U.S. deadline for other countries to strike deals looms. The effective U.S. tariff rate based on announced policies has climbed to 13% from 3% at the start of the year, Goldman Sachs analysts said last week. Even if some of the harshest levies are rolled back, higher effective tariffs this year could still drive up inflation and cut into company profits and consumer spending. KEY QUOTE ""Single-name CDS activity was particularly prevalent in the UK, making up 98% of European traded notional, compared to 2% in the EU,"" the ISDA report said. This week, trade tensions topped a list of investor concerns alongside deepening worries over a potential global recession, a Bank of America investor survey showed on Monday. BY THE NUMBERS Notional European CDS trading rose 28% to $3 trillion in the first quarter compared to $2.3 trillion in the first quarter of 2024, driven by heightened activity in index CDS, ISDA said. UK-reported trades represented roughly 75% of total European CDS notional trading, and almost 82% of the total trade count, while the EU accounted for around 25% and 18%, respectively, the report said.

Raymond James bumps Hyatt rating as $2 bln resort sale eases balance sheet worries,2025-07-02 01:57:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/raymond-james-bumps-hyatt-rating-165730217.html,"Investing.com -- Raymond James on Tuesday upgraded Hyatt Hotels Corp to Strong buy and lifted its price target to $165, saying a $2 billion deal to offload recently acquired Playa Hotels & Resorts real‑estate assets removes a “significant overhang” on the stock. Hyatt shares were up about 5% Tuesday at $146 in trading.

RJ said the agreement to sell all 15 Playa resorts to Tortuga Resorts, a joint venture between KSL Capital Partners and Mexico’s Rodina, came sooner than expected, covered the full portfolio and accelerates Hyatt’s target of raising $2 billion from asset sales by 2027. The deal values the properties at roughly eight times forecast 2024 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and is due to close before year‑end 2025. Raymond James wrote that the transaction “removes a significant overhang on the stock” and praised management’s execution despite macro‑economic uncertainty. It called investors’ muted initial reaction “a bit of a head‑scratcher,” arguing progress on disposals was more important than the sale multiple. The broker noted Hyatt now trades about 2.5 EBITDA turns below Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR.O) and five turns below Hilton Worldwide (NYSE:HLT) even though more than 90% of Hyatt’s earnings are expected to come from fee‑based, asset‑light operations by 2027. Hyatt has lagged Marriott by nine percentage points and Hilton by 19 points so far this year, it added. Following the divestiture, Hyatt’s net purchase price for Playa’s management contracts falls to roughly $555 million, or about nine times projected 2026 EBITDA, with a potential $143 million earn‑out tied to performance. The company will keep $200 million of preferred equity in the venture and retain 50‑year management agreements on 13 of the resorts, preserving fee income while lightening its balance sheet. Hyatt bought Playa for $2.6 billion only two weeks ago to expand in the fast‑growing all‑inclusive segment. The swift flip of the bricks‑and‑mortar assets “underscores management’s commitment to an asset‑light strategy,” Raymond James said.

CEO Spends 1.83 Million Amex Points to Pay Surprise Tariff Bill,2025-07-02 01:38:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ceo-spends-1-83-million-110000875.html,"(Bloomberg) -- When a tariff bill for almost $11,000 arrived without warning, Robert Keeley reached for one of his last financial lifelines and cashed in 1.83 million American Express reward points to pay it. Most Read from Bloomberg Struggling Downtowns Are Looking to Lure New Crowds Sprawl Is Still Not the Answer California Exempts Building Projects From Environmental Law “It’s like a needle pin holding back a crack in the dam,” said Keeley, who runs Keeley Electronics, a guitar-pedal manufacturer with 35 employees in Oklahoma City. Keeley’s scramble is part of a broader reckoning for America’s smaller businesses, which are being whipsawed by volatile trade policies. Another blow could land on July 9, the deadline President Donald Trump has imposed on other countries to secure trade deals with the US to avoid higher tariffs. The stakes are especially high for manufacturers with fewer than 100 employees, which account for 93% of the roughly 240,000 US industrial firms. Unlike global conglomerates, these companies often lack the cash reserves, lobbying muscle or supply-chain flexibility to absorb steep tariff hikes or pivot production. Among those feeling the pressure are a tight-knit group of guitar-pedal manufacturers including Keeley, who run boutique businesses that build the stomp boxes that shape the sound of music. The niche industry offers a window into the economic toll of tariff whiplash on smaller firms. Painful Twist To survive, pedal builders are doing something unusual in a competitive business: turning to one another for help. The alliance was started by Julie Robbins, 46, chief executive officer of EarthQuaker Devices in Akron, Ohio. To avoid layoffs among her 35 workers, Robbins tapped the company’s credit line. But she fears that strategy won’t hold and is considering moving some production overseas — a painful twist, given the tariffs were meant to bring jobs home. Trump, speaking last week at the NATO summit in The Hague, said the levies are spurring manufacturers to reshore production. “Factories are being built because they don’t want to pay the tariffs,” he said. And some large companies have promised to invest in domestic manufacturing. Apple Inc. alone plans to spend more than $500 billion in the US over the next four years. But small manufacturers tend not to have the deep pockets or flexibility needed to rebuild supply chains. Many, like EarthQuaker, rely on imported components. The company sources circuit boards, resistors and transistors from China for pedals used by bands including the Black Keys and Guided By Voices. In early May, as tariff rates spiked, nearly 50 people joined the second meeting of the Pedal Builders Support Group, double the turnout of its inaugural call. The rules were clear: no talk of pricing or anything that could be considered collusion. One participant joked that the group sounded like a mini-OPEC. “OPEC jokes are fine,” Robbins quipped. The guest speaker that day was Shawn Phetteplace, campaigns director at Main Street Alliance, a lobbying group for small-business owners. He described how Trump’s first-term trade team included some moderate voices. Today’s administration, he said, is “much more kind of economically nationalist.” Funds Gone Soon, the conversation turned personal. Jon Cusack, 55, runs a pedal manufacturer in Holland, Michigan, that builds delay, reverb and other stomp boxes for his brands and other firms. He said he spent $200,000 on inventory before tariffs took effect, draining his savings. “I’ve gotten to the point where my slush funds are all gone, and I still am facing several tariff bills coming up,” said Cusack, whose 30-person company had revenue of $3.9 million last year. “Can we survive three months, six months, you know, a year? My next step is to mortgage the house, and I really don’t want to do that.” It’s unusual for rivals to share their struggles with one another, but members of the support group are all dealing with the same problem and are part of a tight-knit community, said Zoom participant Josh Scott, who owns Kansas City-based JHS Pedals. He employs 42 workers and had about $10 million of revenue last year. Scott, 43, who also runs a YouTube channel popular with guitar players, has used his platform to explain how tariffs work. He wrote a recent Substack post reminding consumers that “American businesses pay the tariff” — a cost that eventually gets passed along to customers. That pressure may soon show up more broadly. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday he expects the impact of tariffs to show up in inflation data in coming months. And manufacturers are already feeling the weight: US factory activity contracted for a fourth month in June as orders and employment shrank at a faster pace, according to the Institute for Supply Management. In mid-May, Robbins traveled to Washington to testify before the US Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, telling lawmakers that “without immediate relief from the tariffs and ensuing trade war, US manufacturing companies like mine will not survive the summer.” She founded EarthQuaker with her husband, musician Jamie Stillman, in 2004. She told the committee that before this year’s tariffs she bought blank printed circuit boards from China for $1.40 each, compared with $20.70 to $31.19 for domestic alternatives. “That is not a viable option and would push our prices up far beyond what the market will bear,” she said. “And that is just one of the components that we use.” During the Pedal Builders Support Group’s next Zoom meeting, EveAnna Manley, president of Manley Laboratories Inc., shared her own cost-cutting tactics. Her Chino, California, company makes pre-amplifiers, equalizers, microphones and other equipment for recording studios. “We put all our employees down to 30 hours a week, and that’s the baseline they can stay at and still keep their health care,” said Manley, 56. With the factory now only open Monday to Wednesday instead of five days a week “we can save a few dollars on air conditioning,” she said. Keeley shared his own story in the group’s message thread, explaining how he used Amex credit-card points to pay May and June tariff bills totaling $10,987.48 on circuit boards from Golden Shine Electronics (Weng Yuan) Co. in China and other imported components shipped via DHL. “I wanted to share the only ‘play’ I had in combating the tariffs,” Keeley, 55, wrote the group in mid-June. At a follow-up Zoom meeting the next week, frustrations boiled over. For nearly two hours, participants exchanged ideas on how to raise awareness about the impact of tariffs on small US manufacturers. “They are just convinced that we can just start building transistors and resistors and inductors and capacitors,” Cusack said. “I’m supposed to be able to become an expert in every single one of those fields and manufacture all of my own products? They don’t understand what it takes to do all of that.” Robbins agreed that the perception gap has made it harder to get traction with lawmakers and the public. “I don’t think any of us are willing to go down without a fight,” she said. “And I think we all view this as, you know, a threat to our survival.” --With assistance from Mark Niquette.

Republicans ignore debt worry as they push forward on Trump tax-cut bill,2025-07-02 01:31:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/republicans-ignore-debt-worry-push-161710707.html,"By David Morgan, Bo Erickson and Davide Barbuscia WASHINGTON (Reuters) -As President Donald Trump's Republicans push ahead on a sweeping tax-cut and spending bill that nonpartisan analysts say could add $3.3 trillion to the nation's debt over the next decade, they're taking a new approach - denying there is anything to worry about. Instead, they argue that extending and adding to tax cuts signed into law by Trump in 2017 during his first term - which were set to sunset in 2025 to limit their hit to the deficit - will not drive the debt higher. Independent analysts and investors said the approach, which follows years of growing government debt under both parties, threatens to erode the country's fiscal health and further sap confidence in financial markets, already shaken by Moody's move in May to strip the U.S. of its top-tier AAA rating. The bill, passed by the Senate on Tuesday and which House of Representatives Republican leaders aim to pass later this week, will also raise the federal government's self-imposed debt ceiling by $5 trillion, averting the risk of a disastrous default on the nation's $36.2 trillion in debt sometime this summer. A handful of Republican deficit hawks have said that fact alone undercuts their party's argument that the bill does not add to the debt. The National Debt Clock in New York ""They are effectively moving the goal posts and making it much easier to run these incredible deficits ad infinitum,"" said Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist and head of global bonds at PGIM Fixed Income, which manages bond funds worth around $860 billion as of March. ""That should really create concern in the market about these ongoing large budget deficits."" Democrats - effectively sidelined by a Republican maneuver that bypasses normal chamber rules requiring 60 of the 100 senators to agree on most legislation - have blasted the Republican argument as chicanery. They say the bill, which would also lift taxes on tips and overtime, and boost spending on the military and border security while cutting spending on Medicaid and food assistance, will disproportionately help the wealthy and burden lower-income Americans. ""It is fakery. The budget numbers are a fraud, but the deficits will be very real. The prospect of a catastrophic debt spiral is very real,"" Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said on the Senate floor on Monday. 'PROTECTING THEIR WALLETS' Republican Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo argued that extending the 2017 tax cuts will not add to the debt. ""If you don't raise taxes, you're not changing the tax code, you're making it bring in the same revenue that it brought in before,"" said Crapo, of Idaho. ""You're not increasing the deficit, you're protecting their wallets."" Republicans also called Democrats hypocritical for accusing them of driving the deficit higher, noting that during President Joe Biden's term the then-Democratic-controlled Congress passed costly legislation using the same fast-track maneuver to circumvent the 60-vote threshold.

Their approach is backed by business lobbyists including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ""That's a good thing for the American people. That's a good thing for the economy,"" Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham said in a floor speech. The bond market has shown signs of worry about the bill not passing in time to raise the debt ceiling, which would risk a devastating default. In recent weeks, the interest rate on some Treasury debt due in August has risen more than yields of short-term Treasury bills coming due around the same time, a sign investors are nervous. This also happened in 2023, when Congress reached a last-minute deal to avoid what would have been a catastrophic default. As Republicans have pushed forward on a bill expected to drive the debt higher, Trump has stepped up his campaign against Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, repeatedly urging him to slash U.S. interest rates to 1%, a move that would dull the bill's deficit effects. DEEPENING DEFICITS If the legislation now passes the House and gets signed into law by Trump, independent analysts warn that Americans can look forward to growing deficits, rising interest rates, waning economic vitality and mounting debt - if not an outright dislocation in U.S. bond markets.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) · ASSOCIATED PRESS ""Republicans can spin it any way they want, but ultimately we're heading towards deficits of $4 trillion within a decade,"" said Jessica Riedl, a former Senate Republican aide who is now a senior fellow at the right-leaning Manhattan Institute. U.S. government debt interest payments have surged over the past few years, going from about $500 billion in 2020 to over $1.1 trillion last year. Analysts and investors warn of a longer-term danger from the precedent set by the Senate bill, saying it provides a template that both parties can use in coming years to hide the cost of legislative priorities that expand the debt and deficits. Shai Akabas, vice president of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, warned that the alternative Republican baseline marks a dangerous new chapter in American political rhetoric and calls into question the readiness of political leaders to operate transparently. ""We have, I believe, entered a realm where there is no longer a consistent set of facts or independent sources that are being used,"" Akabas told Reuters. ""It makes it very difficult for the American public to understand what the consequences of legislation are going to be."" (Editing by Scott Malone and Nia Williams)"
"Trump's tariffs kept Fed from cutting rates, Jerome Powell says",2025-07-02 01:31:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-tariffs-kept-fed-cutting-163113870.html,"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has repeatedly sought to defend the central bank's independence from political influence. (Kent Nishimura / Getty Images) The Federal Reserve would have cut interest rates by now if President Donald Trump's tariffs weren't so substantial, central bank chief Jerome Powell said Tuesday. Trump’s ever-changing tariff agenda has caused months of deep uncertainty for global markets and businesses. Many have struggled to make predictions and plan ahead for duties that have shifted, sometimes with no warning other than social media posts by the president. “Chair, would the Fed have cut [rates] more by now if it weren’t for the tariffs?” Bloomberg News anchor Francine Lacqua asked Powell at the European Central Bank’s annual forum in Sintra, Portugal. “So I do think that’s right,” Powell responded. “In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs. We didn’t overreact. In fact, we didn’t react at all; we’re simply taking some time.” The Fed chair's comments underscored a stance he has stuck to despite unrelenting, norm-shattering attacks by Trump and his top allies urging the central bank to lower interest rates. The pressure campaign has led Powell to repeatedly defend the central bank's independence from political influence — a position the Supreme Court appeared to bolster in a ruling last month — along with the decision to hold rates steady. “As long as the U.S. economy is in solid shape, the prudent thing to do is to wait and learn more and see what the effect might be,” Powell said Tuesday. “We haven’t seen effects much from tariffs, and we didn’t expect to by now. We have always said the timing, amount and persistence would be highly uncertain.” He added that the import taxes' ultimate impact on the economy could wind up being either greater or less than currently anticipated. Powell declined to weigh in on the likelihood of a July rate cut, saying, “It’s going to depend on the data.” Trump renewed his rebukes Tuesday, telling reporters in Florida that “anybody” would be better atop the Fed. He bashed Powell again hours later, saying aboard Air Force One: ""We have a moron at the head of the Fed. He's a moron."" Asked about the impact of Trump's insult-laden criticism , Powell said, “I’m very focused on just doing my job.” He said the only two things that matter to him and fellow rate-setting officials are full employment and price stability — the two sides of the Fed's so-called dual mandate. The ECB conference attendees applauded his response. Trump has expanded his attacks to include the committee that sets interest rates, saying Monday that its members should be “ashamed” of current monetary policy. “The Board just sits there and watches, so they are equally to blame. We should be paying 1% Interest, or better,"" Trump posted on social media. In fact, the Federal Open Market Committee members vote during each of their meetings on whether to adjust interest rates after spending a day deliberating. Afterward, many voting members often explain their rationale for supporting or opposing the committee's decision, including in speeches or written papers. Trump appointed Powell to lead the Fed during his first term in office. He also named two of its current board members, Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller. Asked in Sintra how she would handle political pressure akin to what Powell faces, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said, “I think we would do exactly the same thing as our colleague Jay Powell does.” Other panelists, who included governors of the central banks of Korea and Japan, said they agreed with Lagarde, drawing further applause. Last week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said administration officials have discussed appointing the next Fed chair to the earliest board seat available. The term of Biden-appointee Adriana Kugler ends in January 2026, meaning “an October, November” nomination, according to Bessent. Powell would not say Tuesday whether he planned to remain on the board of the Federal Reserve System after his term as chair ends in May 2026. He could remain as a board member until January 2028, if he chooses to. “I want to hand over to my successor an economy in good shape,” Powell said. CORRECTION (July 1, 2025, 1:40 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated when Powell's term ends as Fed chairman. It is in May 2026, not May 2025.

Technology can boost corporate reporting,2025-07-02 01:28:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/technology-boost-corporate-reporting-162815306.html,"The integration of technology in corporate reporting could significantly enhance the delivery of relevant and reliable information for corporate decision-making, according to a new report. The primary conclusion have been drawn from a recent collaboration between academics and professional accountants, as per the findings of the British Accounting and Finance Association Financial Accounting and Reporting Special Interest Group (FARSIG). Despite the potential benefits, the report also suggests that the availability of real-time, high-quality data that meets stakeholder needs is not yet within easy reach. The challenges of geopolitical tensions, inflation, and climate change underscore the need for timely and connected financial and sustainability information, which was a focal point of FARSIG's annual symposium. FARSIG chairman and senior lecturer in accounting and finance at Royal Holloway, University of London Christian Stadler commented on the symposium's discussions: ""FARSIG’s symposium this year explored how corporate reporting fuelled by technology will transition from a conventional compliance exercise to a value-creating exercise. As the role of accountants expands to include advisory and business partnering, data-driven insights enhance the relevance and credibility of the advice they can provide to their colleagues and clients alike."" Stadler also emphasised the importance of maintaining trust and integrity in the profession, stating, ""Balancing optimism with governance helps accountants to stay level-headed and build a culture of experimentation while respecting the ethical use of technology and data protection."" The 2025 FARSIG symposium delved into how technology is transforming the accountancy profession across various sectors, examining the impact of big data, blockchain, AI, and cloud accounting on the future of corporate reporting. It also addressed the valuation and disclosure of an organisation's AI capabilities and the integration of AI with other technologies. The symposium highlighted the beckoning future of financial management through cloud accounting and big data, which promises real-time analysis and access, fostering collaboration and enhancing predictive capabilities and financial planning. Additionally, it sparked a debate on the necessity of the traditional annual report in the age of emerging technologies. The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) head of sustainable business, policy and insights Sharon Machado expressed appreciation for FARSIG's work, saying, ""FARSIG’s work always gives a fascinating glimpse of the key emerging issues in financial reporting and it is gratifying to see how many of the themes this academic group explores is echoed in the work that ACCA does through its professional insights programme. We continue to value our relationship with FARSIG."" ""Technology can boost corporate reporting"" was originally created and published by The Accountant , a GlobalData owned brand.

Trump’s deportation threat to Elon Musk sends Tesla stock to 3-week low,2025-07-02 01:25:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-deportation-threat-elon-musk-162533182.html,"Trump’s deportation threat to Elon Musk sends Tesla stock to 3-week low originally appeared on TheStreet . In a fresh new twist amid the Trump and Musk feud, President Donald Trump has suggested that billionaire Elon Musk, who is now the richest man in the world, may have more to lose than just electric vehicle (EV) requirements in their intensifying spat. When asked about deporting Musk, President Trump said, ""he might have to take a look."" On Truth Social, the President also wrote that Elon Musk might have to ""close up shop and go back home."" Crypto billionaires butt heads Trump's vague comment suggested that the South African-born Musk might have some citizenship-related issues, sparking internet fears that these could be linked to the U.S. President's immigration reform policies. President Donald Trump and Elon Musk have both been very closely tied to the crypto industry. Join the discussion with Scott Melker on Roundtable here. Musk, for instance, has been bullish on Bitcoin and Dogecoin , which has boosted widespread interest and investment in digital currencies. While President Trump is often known as the 'crypto president' for his pro-crypto reforms within the industry and his promise to make the US the 'crypto capital of the world'. Tension between Trump and Musk had been simmering before it reached its current boiling point, as Musk publicly criticized the president's "" Big, Beautiful Bill"", which claims to offer large cuts to taxes and services such as healthcare and food assistance but could push the debt ceiling over the current $3 trillion, believes Trump. Join the discussion with WendyO on Roundtable here. Musk told Forbes on June 5 that Bitcoin is going to ""take over,"" pointing to concerns about a $40 trillion collapse of the U.S. dollar, with some of the blame attributed to Trump's big bill. Crypto enthusiasts in the U.S. are struggling to reconcile Musk's political support with Trump's policy. At press time, Bitcoin is down to $106,580.78 from $107,000 mark seen on June 30. Trump's suggestion that Musk might be stripped of citizenship coincides with an administration-wide ""America First"" immigration agenda aimed at restricting immigration to protect American values, and Musk's advocacy aligns with this agenda. Tesla stocks have also been negatively impacted by the feud between Trump and Musk. At press time, Tesla stock (TSLA) has been down by over 5.72% in pre-market trading. The company's stock dropped sharply to $296.01, marking a three-week low as of July 1.

"Challenge to dollar supremacy a long way off, central bankers say",2025-07-02 01:07:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/challenge-dollar-supremacy-long-way-160745693.html,"By Francesco Canepa and Balazs Koranyi SINTRA, Portugal (Reuters) -There is no prospect of a major challenge to the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency of choice any time soon, central bankers gathered for an annual conference in the Portuguese resort of Sintra said on Tuesday. U.S. President Donald Trump's unpredictable economic, trade and security policies have spurred questions over whether the U.S. currency, which accounts for 58% of the world's reserves, can remain at the centre of the global monetary system. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, who has argued the euro could over time become an alternative to the dollar if Europe's currency zone enacted necessary reforms, said 2025 could in future be viewed as ""pivotal"" in this respect. ""(But) for a major change to occur it will take a lot of time and a lot of effort,"" she told a panel with her U.S., British, Japanese and Korean counterparts. She noted that ""investors are looking at options"" in a climate characterised by uncertainty and unpredictability and that there was evidence that the euro was benefiting from that. ""It's not going to happen just like that overnight. It never did historically,"" she said. ""But there is clearly something that has been broken. Whether it is fixable, or whether it is going to continue to be broken - I think the jury's out."" Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda also noted that any significant change would depend on structural reforms. ""It's to a certain extent up to what areas like Europe or China will do in terms of improving the efficiency or convenience of their currencies,"" he said, citing as an example the efforts at capital market integration in the euro zone. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said any change to the dollar's status was a long way off. ""I don't see ... a sort of a major shift at the moment,"" he said, arguing that any reserve currency had to offer a supply of safe assets into the market that can be used for purposes of collateral and security. Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong said the prospect of a long-term shift of the dollar sentiment was a subject of discussion for some even as they retained their dollar holdings. ""It looks like people are talking about it. But at this moment they keep the dollar share while increasing their hedging ratio,"" he told the panel. Lagarde told a recent audience in Berlin that there was an opening for a ""global euro moment"", if it earned it. She said Europe would need to build a deeper, more liquid capital market, bolster its legal foundations and underpin its commitment to open trade with security capabilities. While the dollar's current share of international reserves is the lowest it has been in decades, its 58% tally is still well above the euro's 20% share. (Writing by Mark John.

Russia launches accounts with withdrawal guarantees for foreign investors,2025-07-02 00:39:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/russia-launches-accounts-withdrawal-guarantees-153941416.html,"MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russia has launched a new type of investment account that contains withdrawal guarantees, according to a decree signed by President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, as Moscow looks to attract foreign investors to the Russian stock market. Since sweeping international sanctions were imposed against Moscow over the Ukraine conflict, Russia has frozen billions of roubles of Western investors' cash in special ""type-C"" accounts inside Russia and seized dozens of businesses with links to foreign ownership. The need to revive foreign investment was a talking point at an economic forum in St Petersburg last month, although the absence of big Western investors and failure to secure significant deals with other partners highlighted Moscow's problem. Foreigners will be able to make new investments in roubles, foreign currency, stocks and bonds in new ""In"" accounts, the decree said. The finance ministry said it was working on softening capital controls for new investment when discussing the changes late last year. Alexei Yakovlev, head of the ministry's financial policy department, said in December that investors from all countries should be entitled to take advantage of the new rules, not just those from countries Russia considers ""friendly"".

Billionaire H&M founding family speeds up share purchases,2025-07-02 00:36:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-h-m-founding-family-153605518.html,"By Helen Reid and Greta Rosen Fondahn LONDON/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -The billionaire Persson family has picked up the pace of share purchases in the H&M fashion empire it founded, regulatory filings showed on Tuesday, potentially boosting speculation the company may eventually be taken private. The family's Ramsbury Invest holding company, primarily owned by Sweden's richest man Stefan Persson, bought 42.75 million H&M shares in the first half of this year, according to the Swedish financial regulator, with the most recent transaction on Monday. That is a faster pace so far than in 2024, when Ramsbury Invest purchased 56.85 million shares over the year as a whole, and in 2023, when the family bought 55.65 million shares. ""As the family owns more shares they have a higher dividend to reinvest which would support increased share purchases,"" said Deutsche Bank analyst Adam Cochrane, who expects the family to take H&M private by 2030. The Persson family and its related companies owned more than 64% of H&M's shares at the end of May, according to the company's website. H&M referred Reuters' questions about the share purchases to a spokesperson for Ramsbury Invest, who declined to comment on the stake-building or on the possibility of the company being taken private. ""I think they will, in due time, take it private - the question is, is it now, or in ten or 20 years?"" said Peter Magnusson, portfolio manager at Cicero Fonder in Stockholm. The family would likely need to find external financing or partners to buy the whole company, Magnusson added. H&M's market value is around 187 billion Swedish crowns ($19.7 billion). Investment bankers expect more publicly-listed retailers to go private, since U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs have dented share prices and driven market volatility. H&M's share price is down 9% since the start of this year. H&M was founded by Erling Persson in 1947, and his son Stefan took over as CEO in 1982, staying in the role for 27 years before handing over to his son Karl-Johan Persson in 2009. In 2020, H&M got its first chief executive from outside the family, with Karl-Johan becoming chair.

The company also trailed the Retail-Wholesale sector’s growth of 4.2% and the S&P 500's growth of 4.6% during the same period. TGT’s Past 6 Months’ Performance Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The recent decline in the TGT stock’s price is led by the reduced fiscal 2025 guidance amid softer consumer demand, lower spending per visit and declining store traffic. Persistent margin pressures from elevated markdown activity and rising digital fulfillment costs have weighed on profitability, raising concerns about the company’s ability to defend earnings amid a cautious retail environment. Target has also underperformed its peers, including Dollar General Corporation DG, Dollar Tree, Inc. DLTR and Costco Wholesale Corporation COST. Shares of Dollar General, Dollar Tree and Costco have rallied 51.2%, 29.5% and 8.8%, respectively, over the same period. TGT’s Performance vs. Peer Performance Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Closing at $98.65 in yesterday’s trading session, the TGT stock stands 41.1% below its 52-week high of $167.40 reached on Aug. 21. Target is trading below its 100 and 200-day simple moving averages of $103.36 and $121.75, respectively, signaling bearish sentiment in maintaining the recent performance levels. TGT Trades Below 50 & 200-Day Moving Averages Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The recent slide in the stock has contributed to Target’s discounted status. This leading general merchandise retailer is currently trading at a compelling discount relative to its industry. The TGT stock trades at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 12.75, lower than the industry’s average of 32.30. TGT P/E Ratio (Forward 12 Months) Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The current valuation appears compelling when compared with peers. Dollar General, Dollar Tree and Costco are all trading at higher forward P/E ratios of 19.01, 17.34, and 50.57, respectively. What’s Behind TGT’s Dismal Stock Run? Target’s stock has been under pressure following its disappointing first quarter fiscal 2025 results and a significant cut to its full-year guidance. The company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.30, sharply down from $2.03 in the same quarter last year. Total sales also fell 2.8% year over year to $23.85 billion. In response to its weaker-than-expected performance, Target revised its full-year outlook. It now projects a low-single-digit decline in sales and has lowered its adjusted EPS guidance to $7.00-$9.00 from the earlier mentioned $8.80-$9.80. At the core of Target’s challenges is its struggling retail performance, especially in physical stores, which remain the key part of its business model. Comparable sales dropped 3.8% year over year, led by a significant 5.7% decline in comparable store sales. Overall traffic fell 2.4% and average transaction size declined 1.4%. Margin pressures further dampened investor sentiment. The gross margin fell by 60 basis points to 28.2% due to increased markdown activity and rising costs tied to digital fulfillment and supply-chain operations. Margin pressures were influenced by higher digital sales penetration and costs related to the ramp-up of new supply-chain facilities. Operational costs also rose sharply. Increased costs related to labor investments, healthcare costs, general liability and startup costs associated with new capital projects pressured Target’s fiscal first quarter adjusted EPS by approximately 50 cents year over year. Increased investments in wages, healthcare benefits and store openings added about 50 cents of year-over-year pressure on the fiscal first quarter adjusted EPS. Combined with deleveraging effects from lower sales and rising SG&A costs, Target’s profitability has taken a significant hit. Further complicating the challenge are external risks such as tariff uncertainties and macroeconomic pressures. Downward Estimate Revisions Signal Pressure on TGT’s Earnings Reflecting cautious sentiment around Target, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS has seen downward revisions. Over the past 30 days, the consensus estimates for the current and next fiscal years have declined by seven cents to $7.55 and five cents to $8.15 per share, respectively. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.) Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Target’s Game Plan to Overcome Current Challenges TGT is taking several steps to navigate the ongoing challenges in the retail environment. Leveraging its strong brand reputation and broad product assortment, the company continues to expand its e-commerce capabilities and physical store presence. A major growth driver is Target Plus, its third-party marketplace, which saw a 20% year-over-year increase in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) in the fiscal first quarter. By adding hundreds of partners and targeting $5 billion in GMV by 2030, Target aims to deepen customer engagement, particularly in key categories like home and apparel. A significant part of Target’s strategy also focuses on enhancing customer loyalty through its membership program, Target Circle 360. Same-day delivery services tied to this program grew more than 35% in the fiscal first quarter, showcasing how exclusive benefits and faster fulfillment are helping drive customer retention and repeat purchases. In addition to digital growth, Target remains committed to strengthening its physical store network. The company opened three stores in the fiscal first quarter and plans to add 20 locations by the end of the year. It is also heavily investing in store remodels, which have proven effective in boosting sales. Completed remodels have delivered a 2-4% rise in comparable sales in the first year and close to 3% in the second year, reflecting improved customer shopping experiences and increased store productivity. On the supply-chain side, Target is proactively mitigating risks associated with tariffs and international trade uncertainties. The company has diversified its sourcing strategy, reducing its dependency on China from 60% in 2017 to under 30% in the fiscal first quarter, with a goal of bringing it below 25% by 2026. Target is also working closely with vendor partners, adjusting its buying and production strategies, and exploring alternative sourcing locations to cushion the impacts of potential future tariffs. By combining digital innovation, customer-centric programs, store investments and supply-chain resilience, Target is positioning itself to better weather short-term pressures and drive long-term growth. How to Play TGT Stock: Buy, Hold or Sell? Given the magnitude of challenges facing Target, including declining store traffic, pressured margins and a downwardly revised earnings outlook, current and potential investors may want to adopt a cautious stance. While the company is actively pursuing initiatives to stabilize performance, such as digital expansion, loyalty programs and supply-chain diversification, those efforts will take time to materially shift the trajectory. Until there is clearer evidence of a turnaround, staying on the sidelines or closely monitoring execution progress may be the more prudent course of action.

"AstraZeneca considers moving listing to US, the Times reports",2025-07-01 23:58:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/astrazeneca-ceo-eyes-us-market-145856585.html,"(Reuters) -AstraZeneca is considering moving its stock market listing from London, where it is the exchange's most valuable company, to the United States, the Times reported on Tuesday, citing multiple sources. Any such move would be a major blow to the UK stock market, which has seen a string of delistings and missed out on some major initial public offerings in recent months. It would also appeal to President Donald Trump's hopes of drawing investment to the United States, even as his trade policy has created uncertainty for global companies. He has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on pharmaceutical imports. CEO Pascal Soriot has privately expressed a preference to shift AstraZeneca's listing on multiple occasions and has also discussed relocating the company's domicile, the Times said. AstraZeneca, which has a market value of about 156 billion pounds ($213 billion), declined to comment. The company has for years criticised the UK business investment climate. In January it scrapped plans to invest 450 million pounds in its vaccine manufacturing plant in northern England, citing a cut in government support. Meanwhile, the company has been strengthening its ties to the U.S. over the past year, both in terms of manufacturing investment and contacts with investors and lawmakers. Its U.S. plans include a $3.5 billion investment in domestic manufacturing by the end of 2026. The company earlier this year also rejoined the leading U.S. drug lobby group, roughly two years after leaving it. The U.S. is also AstraZeneca's largest market, accounting for about 42% of its revenue in the first quarter of this year. Soriot could face opposition from some board members and the UK government if he pursues the move, according to the Times report, which added that the government had not been informed. London-listed shares in AstraZeneca last traded up 2.8% at 10,328 pence.

“Brace!” Endless disruptions mark new path to supply chain resiliency,2025-07-01 23:47:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brace-endless-disruptions-mark-path-144737720.html,"It’s a disrupted supply chain world, and we’re just living in it. Or are we? In a world increasingly marked by uncertainty and volatility, supply chain resilience is a critical focus for businesses worldwide. “The New Normal: Building Resilient Supply Chains in a World of Constant Disruptions,” a podcast hosted by Maersk (OTC: AMKBY ), took a deep dive into the myriad factors impacting global trade and how shippers can thrive amid these challenges. Geopolitics has emerged as a central theme influencing supply chains. During the discussion, James Hookham, director of the Global Shippers Forum, underscored how geopolitical tensions and policy shifts significantly contribute to trade disruptions. He advises shippers, exporters, and importers to brace for continued instability. “The world just seems to be in a different paradigm at the moment,” Hookham said, highlighting that disruptions are not solely political but also driven by climate change, extreme weather events, and labor disputes. Zera Zheng, global head of business resilience at Maersk, echoed this sentiment, indicating that disruptions are becoming a persistent element of global trade operations. She refers to these challenges as “compound disruptions,” where multiple issues intersect to create complex challenges for businesses. “We’re moving into a new mindset of compound disruption where there’s just one thing after another,” Zheng said, suggesting that companies need to adapt to an environment where disruptions are continuous and multifaceted. At the midpoint of 2025, companies face several key challenges. Tariff uncertainties, particularly U.S. tariffs, loom large. Zheng points out the legal ambiguities surrounding tariffs, especially following the U.S. Court of International Trade’s ruling on the IEEPA Emergency Act. “There’s a new twist emerging … creating uncertainties for shippers,” she warned, indicating that these legal fluctuations could have widespread implications for logistics and trade strategies. Climate risks also constitute a formidable challenge. With forecasts suggesting a hotter and drier year for Europe, Zheng emphasized the need for vigilance concerning natural phenomena like wildfires and hurricanes. “The overall weather patterns appear quite milder than the past two years, but certain regions still need closer attention.” These environmental disruptions demand that supply chain leaders incorporate climate resilience into their strategic planning. Against this backdrop of perpetual disruption, the question arises: should businesses adopt a proactive stance or a “wait and see” approach? Hookham offers a decisive perspective, advocating for proactive measures. “You’re gonna need more people to help you out here. This is not business as usual,” he said, emphasizing the necessity of readying human resources and strategic plans to address complex, fast-evolving challenges. Zheng built on this proactive narrative, arguing against complacency. “Actually, we will not ask or advise our customers just to wait and see,” she said. Instead, she stressed the importance of having timely risk visibility and scenario planning. By analyzing potential scenarios and preparing actionable responses, businesses can not only anticipate risks but also enhance their capacity to respond swiftly and effectively when disruptions manifest themselves. Data plays a pivotal role in this context. The vast amounts of information available in modern supply chains offer a powerful tool for resilience. Zheng highlighted how historical data on disruptions, such as port recovery times after cyclones, can guide strategic decisions. “It’s about how you use the data to ask “What does that mean for my cargo, for my timelines, and also for my options,”” she said, underscoring data’s role as a strategic asset in forecasting and mitigating risks. Digitalization further emerges as a cornerstone of future resilience. Hookham called for a digital overhaul of supply chain processes, moving beyond traditional and disconnected systems. “The recommendation is that [shippers] evaluate the business case not on a business-as-usual basis, but as a business under crisis,” he said, and urged companies to leverage technology for enhanced real-time insights, interoperability, and security. In a context where disruptions are not abating, digital readiness can empower organizations to remain agile and competitive. Collaboration between carriers and shippers is an essential strategy emphasized by both experts. Said Hookham, “Carriers are leaning into this business,” indicating a growing willingness within the industry to work together. Such collaboration can facilitate the flow of critical information across the supply chain, enabling all parties to make informed decisions and fostering a collective approach to overcoming disruptions.

Since April, everyday goods have spiked in price due to the Trump tariffs and the worst hikes might be yet to come, which is why it’s good to buy what you can now to avoid spending more money than you’d like to in the future. Here’s how much money you can save by stocking up on essentials now (before tariffs hit harder) . Non-Perishables Average savings: Between 10 to 20% on average by buying these items in bulk now Rice, pasta, canned goods and other non-perishables for your pantry should be the first items to stock up on, according to James E. Francis, the founder and CEO of Paradigm Asset Management . “These are things that are essential to almost every household, and their price tags can soar when demand rises,” Francis explained. “A stash of these things now, particularly in bulk, is insurance against the price spikes you’ll encounter when you run through the stuff in your pantry over the next few months.” “Avoid stocking goods that have a short shelf life or have unstable prices,” advised Steve Case, a finance and insurance consultant with Insurance Hero , adding that products which have the likelihood of price alterations may not be directly affected by tariffs, and the hoarding of such products may lead to wastage or unnecessary expenditure.

The savings really start to add up here, especially if you get a bulk discount. This isn’t hoarding-it is being prepared and saving money.” Case illustrated this point with the example of purchasing a six-month supply of cleaning products today, when prices are stable, can save consumers approximately 10 to 15% off of waiting. “This accumulates, particularly on items that are used regularly,” Case described. “Consider how much you spend each year, and work out savings on a small rise in prices, which might well be $20 to $30 or more a year.” Appliances Average savings: Between 5 to 15% on average by buying these items in bulk now Whether that’s a more energy-efficient washing machine or a new fridge, Francis recommended that consumers should spend time factoring in those upfront expenses, which while hurting for a little bit will save them down the line in utility bills. “By buying those things at today’s prices, you can shield yourself from the worst of the price inflation,” noted Francis. “ The stocking up of necessities before the imminent tariffs can be a great cost-saving strategy, but it needs to be done strategically,” concluded Case. “Stock up on durable items that you are certain will be increasing in price.” More From GOBankingRates I'm a Realtor: This Is Why No One Wants To See Your Home 3 Things Retirees Should Stop Buying To Save Money Amid Tariffs 10 Cars That Outlast the Average Vehicle 4 Affordable Car Brands You Won't Regret Buying in 2025 This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : Here’s How Much Money You Can Save by Stocking Up on Essentials Now (Before Tariffs Hit Harder)"
Powell says the Fed would have cut rates this year if it weren’t for tariffs,2025-07-01 23:42:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/powell-says-fed-cut-rates-144207158.html,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs on June 25 in Washington, DC. - Kent Nishimura/Getty Images The Federal Reserve would likely have lowered interest rates this year if it weren’t for President Donald Trump’s significant policy changes, Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday. “I do think that’s right,” he said at a central banking forum in Sintra, Portugal, when asked if the Fed would have cut rates by now. The Fed hasn’t lowered interest rates at all this year: Central bankers broadly expect Trump’s tariffs to have some effect on the US economy and they’ve said that they want to see how the dust settles first before resuming rate cuts. But the Fed’s wait-and-see approach hasn’t sat well with Trump, who has repeatedly lashed out against Powell for not yet lowering rates, describing him as a “numbskull” and a “moron.” On Monday, Trump posted on his social media platform a note in his handwriting slamming Powell for keeping interest rates higher than dozens of other nations, writing that he “cost the USA a fortune” and that he continues “to do so.” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the note was delivered to the Fed that same day. Trump hasn’t been the only one calling for rate cuts. Two of Powell’s colleagues — Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman and Fed Governor Christopher Waller — have recently broken rank and said the central bank could consider a rate cut as soon as July. But neither of them has gone as far as to call for the supersized rate cuts Trump has demanded. Both have said rate cuts still depend on how mild any tariff-induced inflation turns out to be. Still, a rate cut in July seems unlikely and would be difficult for the Fed to defend. Investors estimate a 81% chance of the Fed holding rates steady at its July 29-30 meeting, according to futures, compared with a 19% chance of a quarter-point rate cut. Powell in his Sintra panel noted that most Fed officials expect to lower rates at some point later this year, depending on what happens with inflation and the labor market. “A solid majority of (Fed officials) do expect that it will become appropriate later this year to begin to reduce rates again,” Powell said. When asked if July would be too soon for a rate cut, Powell said “he can’t say” but that he “wouldn’t take any meeting off the table or put it directly on the table.” European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde — who has publicly backed Powell’s apolitical, data-driven approach to policymaking — praised the Fed leader on Monday, noting that he “epitomizes the standard of a courageous central banker.” She was on the panel with Powell Tuesday. So far, Powell has avoided commenting on Trump’s attacks, including on Tuesday when he was asked if Trump’s harsh public comments make it difficult to conduct monetary policy. Powell said that “I’m very focused on just doing my job.” Lagarde was asked how she would handle Trump’s criticism if she were in Powell’s position, to which she responded: “I think we would (all) do exactly the same thing as our colleague, Jay Powell, does. The same thing.” Conference attendees clapped after Lagarde’s comment. “We’re trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,” Powell said. “If we’re going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely non-political way, which means we don’t take sides. We don’t play one side against the other. We stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.” For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com"

"US manufacturing activity improved in June, but sentiment remains low",2025-07-01 23:38:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-manufacturing-activity-improved-june-143800116.html,"This story was originally published on Manufacturing Dive . To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Manufacturing Dive newsletter . Stronger production and inventory activity drove an improvement in U.S. manufacturing performance last month despite weaker demand, tariff uncertainty and inflation continuing to weigh on companies, according to the Institute for Supply Management’s June Purchasing Managers’ Index . The ISM’s index registered 49% in June, up 0.5 percentage points compared to the month prior. A PMI reading below 50% indicates the industry is in contraction. Production recovered to 50.3% after four months of contraction, rising 4.9 percentage points from May. Additionally, inventories improved to 49.2%, up 2.5 percentage points from the previous month following a cargo surge ahead of the expected return of the Trump administration’s country-specific reciprocal tariffs in July. As supplier deliveries slowed, there was improved performance clearing goods through ports of entry, the report said. Despite overall manufacturing activity improvement in June, demand remains weak in the face of trade uncertainty and increased prices, Susan Spence, chair of the institute’s Manufacturing Business Survey Committee, said on a call Tuesday morning. “The biggest issue on our panelists' minds continues to be the effect of tariffs on their supply chain and their cost structure,” Spence said. Demand indicators such as new orders, backlog orders and new export orders continued to decline month over month in June as prices increased, according to the index report. Meanwhile, employment remained in contraction mode for the fifth-straight month as layoffs plague the sector. In terms of overall sentiment, for every positive comment from survey participants in last month’s report, 11 were negative, Spence said. That is up significantly from last month, when the ratio was about one to five, she added. “We feel the fatigue continues with the tariff and whiplash uncertainty that we have,” Spence said. Comparatively, S&P Global’s U.S. manufacturing index was more upbeat at 52.9% , its highest reading since May 2022. Upturns in output and sustained orders spurred employment growth and improved sentiment, per Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence. However, tariffs and inflation continue to lead manufacturers to pass increased costs on to customers. “The big question of course is whether this merely results in a short-term change in the price level rather than a more worrying return of stubborn inflation,” Williamson said in prepared comments. Business confidence has improved since a low point in April, Williamson said, but he added that “many firms remain cautious as they await news of trade deals as the deadline for paused tariffs draws closer.” Recommended Reading Manufacturing continues to stall as the industry grapples with tariff uncertainty: PMI"
